# Offensive Guide

This guide covers the principles of moving the ball and scoring points in Madden. Mastering offense requires understanding formations, reading defenses, executing both the passing and rushing game, and making smart pre-snap adjustments. This guide will teach you how to identify coverages, call the right plays, use hot routes and audibles, protect the quarterback, and exploit defensive weaknesses.

## Key Concepts

### 1. Formations

**Understanding Personnel Groupings:**
- **11 Personnel** - 1 RB, 1 TE, 3 WR. The most common and versatile package. Good for both passing and running. Forces defense into nickel or base defense.
- **12 Personnel** - 1 RB, 2 TE, 2 WR. Run-heavy package with extra blocking. Good for power running, play action, and short yardage.
- **10 Personnel** - 1 RB, 0 TE, 4 WR. Spread formation that forces defense into dime or nickel. Excellent for passing, weak for running.
- **13 Personnel** - 1 RB, 3 TE, 1 WR. Goal line and short yardage package with maximum blocking.

**Common Formation Types:**
- **Shotgun** - QB starts 5-7 yards behind center. Best for passing plays and gives QB better field vision. Good for obvious passing downs.
- **Pistol** - QB starts 3-4 yards behind center with RB behind him. Combines shotgun vision with better run angles.
- **I-Form** - Traditional formation with FB and RB lined up behind QB. Strong power running formation, excellent for play action.
- **Singleback** - QB under center with one RB. Balanced formation good for both runs and passes.
- **Spread/Empty** - All receivers split out wide, no RB in backfield. Maximum passing options but no pass protection help.

**Choosing the Right Formation:**
- **1st and 10:** Use 11 personnel in Shotgun or Singleback to keep defense honest
- **3rd and short (1-3 yards):** Use 12 or 13 personnel in I-Form or Singleback for power
- **3rd and long (7+ yards):** Use 10 or 11 personnel in Shotgun to maximize receiving options
- **Red zone:** Use 12 or 13 personnel for stronger blocking near the goal line
- **Two-minute drill:** Use Shotgun or Spread to stop the clock and get out of bounds

### 2. Passing Game

**Reading the Defense Pre-Snap:**

Identifying coverage before the snap is crucial for successful passing.

- **Man vs. Zone:** Watch the defensive backs. In man coverage, DBs will follow receivers in motion. In zone, they'll stay in their area.
- **Cover 0 (Man Blitz):** No deep safeties, everyone in man coverage. High pressure, but vulnerable to quick throws and one-on-one matchups.
- **Cover 1 (Man Free):** One deep safety in center, everyone else in man. Look for single-high safety. Weak against slot routes and speed mismatches.
- **Cover 2:** Two safeties split the deep field in half. Safeties start 12-15 yards deep, corners play outside. Vulnerable to seam routes and deep posts between safeties.
- **Cover 2 Man:** Two deep safeties with man coverage underneath. Looks like Cover 2 but DBs follow receivers.
- **Cover 3:** Three deep defenders (2 corners, 1 safety) each cover 1/3 of field. Single-high safety. Vulnerable to corner routes and flat routes.
- **Cover 4 (Quarters):** Two safeties start deep and split with corners into quarters. Everyone has deep responsibility. Weak against underneath routes and crossing patterns.
- **Cover 6:** Half Cover 2, half Cover 4. Different coverages on each side of the field.

**Post-Snap Reads:**

After the snap, confirm the coverage and make your decision:
1. **First read:** Check your primary receiver based on the route concept
2. **Safety movement:** Watch if safeties rotate or stay - this confirms zone or man
3. **Progression:** Work through your reads (primary → secondary → checkdown)
4. **Scramble:** If all covered and pressure comes, run or throw it away

**Route Concepts:**

Effective route combinations attack specific coverages:

- **Flood Concept:** Three receivers to one side at different depths (deep, medium, flat). Overloads zone coverage by putting 3 receivers in 2 zones. Best vs. Cover 2 and Cover 3.
- **Levels Concept:** Three receivers running routes at different depths on the same side. Creates horizontal stretch. Beats Cover 2 and Cover 4.
- **Mesh Concept:** Two receivers cross the middle at the same depth. Creates pick/rub routes. Excellent vs. man coverage.
- **Stick Concept:** Quick route with WR running 5-yard hitch, another running flat route. Good for quick throws vs. blitz.
- **Curl/Flat:** Outside receiver runs curl (10-12 yards), inside receiver runs flat. Puts two receivers in one zone. Beats Cover 2.
- **Verticals/Four Verts:** All receivers run deep routes to stretch the defense vertically. Attacks Cover 2 and Cover 3 down the seams.
- **Smash Concept:** Corner route combined with hitch/curl underneath. High-low read that beats Cover 2.
- **Spacing/Shallow Cross:** Receiver runs shallow crossing route while others create spacing. Beats zone coverage with timing throws.

**Quarterback Mechanics:**

Different pass types serve different purposes:

- **Bullet Pass (Tap receiver button):** Fast, straight throw. Use for short routes (5-15 yards), crossing routes, timing throws, and when throwing into tight windows. Harder to intercept but less forgiving on accuracy.
- **Touch Pass (Hold L1/LB + receiver button):** Medium speed arc throw. Best for intermediate routes (10-20 yards), comeback routes, and throwing over linebackers but under safeties. Most versatile pass type.
- **Lob Pass (Hold receiver button):** High, slow arc. Use for deep routes (20+ yards), jump balls to tall receivers, throwing over defenders in zone coverage, and fade routes. Gives receivers time to adjust but easier to intercept.
- **Low Pass (Hold L2/LT + receiver button):** Thrown at receiver's feet/waist. Use to avoid interceptions, sideline throws to stay inbounds, and passes to prevent linebacker jumps. Safer but can cause incompletions.
- **High Pass (Hold L1/LB + L2/LT + receiver button):** Thrown above receiver's head. Use for back shoulder throws, avoiding defenders underneath, and jump balls. Only tall receivers can catch effectively.
- **Pass Lead (Left stick while throwing):** Aim the pass away from coverage. Lead receivers toward open space, sidelines, or away from defenders. Critical for avoiding interceptions.

**Receiver Routes:**

Understanding individual receiver routes is essential for reading defenses and making the right throws. Each route attacks specific coverages and situations.

**Short Routes (0-10 yards):**

**Slant Route:**
- **What it is:** Receiver takes 2-3 steps upfield, then cuts inside at 45-degree angle
- **Depth:** 5-8 yards
- **Pass type:** Bullet pass
- **Beats:** Off coverage, outside leverage, soft zone coverage, Cover 3 (attacks flat defenders)
- **When to use:**
  - Quick throw vs. blitz (ball out in under 2 seconds)
  - When corners are playing off coverage (5+ yards cushion)
  - When corners have outside leverage
  - 3rd and short (3-5 yards)
  - Against zone coverage with soft middle
- **Why it works:** Fast developing route, creates quick separation inside, difficult for outside leverage to recover
- **Tips:**
  - Throw as receiver makes his cut (timing throw)
  - Lead receiver inside and upfield
  - Combine with other routes to clear out middle
  - Watch for lurking linebackers in the middle

**Hitch Route:**
- **What it is:** Receiver runs 5-7 yards upfield, then stops and turns back to QB

  - 3rd and short to medium
  - When you need to get out of bounds
- **Why it works:** Quick separation to sideline, sideline acts as extra defender, stops clock
- **Tips:**
  - Throw as receiver makes his cut (before he's turned completely)
  - Lead toward sideline
  - Watch for flat defenders (corners in hard flat zones)
  - Receiver should get out of bounds to stop clock

**Drag Route (Shallow Cross):**
- **What it is:** Receiver runs 1-3 yards upfield, then crosses the field horizontally
- **Depth:** 1-5 yards
- **Pass type:** Bullet pass

  - Works best by outside receivers

**Deep Routes (20+ yards):**

**Streak/Go/Fly Route:**
- **What it is:** Receiver runs straight down the field as fast as possible
- **Depth:** 20+ yards
- **Pass type:** Lob pass or touch pass (deep)
- **Beats:** Single coverage, off coverage, Cover 3, defenders with inside leverage
- **When to use:**
  - When receiver has speed advantage over defender
  - Against single-high safety (Cover 1, Cover 3)
  - When corners are playing inside leverage
  - To stretch the defense vertically (clears out underneath)
  - When you have time (4+ seconds)
  - Against heavy blitz (space opens up deep)
- **Why it works:** Speed wins, forces defenders to respect deep ball, clears out space underneath
- **Tips:**
  - Use lob pass to give receiver time to run under it
  - Lead receiver upfield
  - Only throw if receiver has step on defender
  - Often used to clear out space for underneath routes
  - Works best on outside receivers with 90+ speed

**Post Route:**
- **What it is:** Receiver runs 12-15 yards upfield, then breaks toward the middle at 45 degrees
- **Depth:** 15-25 yards (continues upfield)
- **Pass type:** Lob pass or touch pass
- **Beats:** Cover 2 (splits safeties), Cover 3 (attacks deep middle), outside leverage
- **When to use:**
  - Against Cover 2 (runs between the two safeties)
  - Against Cover 3 (safety has to choose which receiver to cover)
  - When corners have outside leverage
  - 3rd and very long (15+ yards)
  - When you need a big play
  - When middle of field is open
- **Why it works:** Attacks the seam between safeties, breaks into open space, hard to defend against Cover 2
- **Tips:**
  - Throw as receiver makes his cut toward middle
  - Lead receiver toward middle and upfield
  - Watch the safeties - if they converge, receiver may be covered
  - Requires good protection (4+ seconds)
  - One of the best routes in Madden vs. Cover 2

**Corner Route:**
- **What it is:** Receiver runs 12-15 yards upfield, then breaks toward the sideline at 45 degrees upfield
- **Depth:** 15-25 yards (continues toward sideline)
- **Pass type:** Lob pass or touch pass
- **Beats:** Cover 2 (attacks corner of end zone), Cover 3 (exploits flat/deep conflict), inside leverage
- **When to use:**
  - Against Cover 2 (corners sit flat, safeties protect middle - corner route attacks the gap)
  - Red zone (attacks back corner of end zone)
  - When corners have inside leverage
  - 3rd and long
  - When you need a big play to sideline
- **Why it works:** Creates conflict for Cover 2 corners (flat or deep?), attacks dead space in coverage
- **Tips:**
  - Throw as receiver breaks toward corner
  - Lead toward sideline and upfield
  - Works great in red zone (back shoulder fade to corner)
  - Best vs. Cover 2 when combined with flat route underneath (high-low read)
  - Requires 4+ seconds to develop

**Fade Route:**
- **What it is:** Receiver runs toward the sideline at a 45-degree angle upfield, back shoulder
- **Depth:** 15-30 yards (depends on throw timing)
- **Pass type:** Lob pass or high pass
- **Beats:** Press coverage, inside leverage, Cover 2 corners, goal line defense
- **When to use:**
  - Red zone (especially goal line to back corner)
  - When you have height advantage (tall WR vs. short CB)
  - Against press coverage (receiver releases outside)
  - Against inside leverage
  - When corners are protecting inside (fades outside)
  - Jump ball situations
- **Why it works:** Back shoulder throw to sideline, only receiver can catch it, height advantage matters
- **Tips:**
  - Use high pass or lob pass
  - Lead toward sideline
  - Throw before receiver gets to sideline (back shoulder)
  - Only works with tall receivers (6'2"+) with good catching stats
  - Best in red zone against smaller corners

**Wheel Route:**
- **What it is:** RB/TE starts toward flat, then turns upfield down the sideline
- **Depth:** 20+ yards (starts at 5, then vertical)
- **Pass type:** Lob pass or touch pass
- **Beats:** Linebackers in man coverage, Cover 2, Cover 3, zone coverage
- **When to use:**
  - When RB/TE is covered by slower linebacker in man coverage
  - Against Cover 2 (attacks sideline deep)
  - When defense expects short RB route (play action works great)
  - 3rd and long when defense forgets about RB
  - When you have a receiving back with speed
- **Why it works:** Linebackers can't keep up with RB down the sideline, creates mismatch
- **Tips:**
  - Hot route RB to wheel vs. man coverage
  - Use lob pass to drop it over LB and under safety
  - Lead receiver upfield along sideline
  - Works best with play action (defense commits to run)
  - Devastating vs. linebackers in man coverage

**Specialty Routes:**

**Crossing Route (Deep Cross):**
- **What it is:** Receiver runs 10-15 yards upfield, then crosses the field horizontally
- **Depth:** 10-15 yards
- **Pass type:** Touch pass or bullet pass
- **Beats:** Man coverage (creates natural picks), zone coverage (finds holes), blitz
- **When to use:**
  - Against man coverage (receiver crosses with other routes creating rubs)
  - When middle of field is open
  - Against zone coverage (finds soft spots)
  - When combined with other crossing routes (mesh concept)
  - 3rd and medium
- **Why it works:** Creates natural pick plays vs. man, finds holes vs. zone, hard to defend without safety help
- **Tips:**
  - Wait for receiver to clear across formation
  - Lead receiver across the field
  - Works best with multiple crossing routes (creates confusion)
  - Watch for lurking safeties in middle

**Seam Route (Vertical Seam):**
- **What it is:** Slot receiver or TE runs straight upfield between hash marks (in the seam)
- **Depth:** 15-25 yards
- **Pass type:** Touch pass or lob pass
- **Beats:** Cover 2 (runs right between the two safeties), Cover 4, zone coverage
- **When to use:**
  - Against Cover 2 (most effective route vs. Cover 2)
  - Against Cover 4 (attacks seam between safety and corner)
  - When slot receiver or TE is in the formation
  - 3rd and long
  - When safeties are spread wide
- **Why it works:** Attacks the biggest weakness of Cover 2 (the seam between safeties), forces safety to choose
- **Tips:**
  - Throw in the window between safeties
  - Lead receiver upfield
  - Watch safeties - if one breaks on it, receiver may be covered
  - Best from slot or TE position
  - Can be combined with corner routes (flood concept)

**Route Selection by Down and Distance:**

**1st and 10:**
- Primary: Curls, slants, hitches, drags (safe completions)
- Secondary: Streaks (stretch defense), posts (big play opportunity)
- Goal: Get 4-6 yards, set up manageable 2nd down

**2nd and short (1-3 yards):**
- Primary: Slants, hitches, outs (quick, guaranteed yards)
- Secondary: Play action with posts or corners (defense expects run)
- Goal: Get the first down

**2nd and medium (4-7 yards):**
- Primary: Curls, outs, ins, comebacks (intermediate routes)
- Secondary: Posts, corners (if you want to be aggressive)
- Goal: Convert to 3rd and short or get first down

**2nd and long (8+ yards):**
- Primary: Ins, deep outs, curls, crossers (intermediate to deep)
- Secondary: Posts, corners, streaks (need big yards)
- Goal: Get back to manageable 3rd down

**3rd and short (1-3 yards):**
- Primary: Slants, hitches, drags, flats (quick, high-percentage)
- Secondary: Play action with posts (if defense is aggressive)
- Goal: Get the first down safely

**3rd and medium (4-10 yards):**
- Primary: Curls, outs, comebacks, ins (routes at or past the sticks)
- Secondary: Crossing routes, seams (if middle is open)
- Goal: Get past the first down marker

**3rd and long (11+ yards):**
- Primary: Deep outs, ins, posts, corners, streaks (need yards)
- Secondary: Crossing routes, seams (find holes in zone)
- Goal: Convert or get enough for 4th down attempt

**Route Selection by Coverage:**

**Vs. Cover 0 (Man Blitz):**
- Best: Slants, drags, hitches, streaks (quick throws or beat man coverage)
- Strategy: Ball out in under 2 seconds, or throw to receiver with speed advantage

**Vs. Cover 1 (Man Free):**
- Best: Slants, drags, crossing routes, streaks (beat man coverage)
- Strategy: Find mismatches, use picks/rubs, throw to space

**Vs. Cover 2:**
- Best: Posts, seams, corner routes, deep outs (attack safeties and corners)
- Strategy: Vertical routes between safeties, high-low corner with corner route + flat

**Vs. Cover 2 Man:**
- Best: Streaks, crossing routes, posts (beat man with safety help deep)
- Strategy: Use picks, find mismatches, go deep against man

**Vs. Cover 3:**
- Best: Curls, flats, outs, corner routes (attack underneath and corners)
- Strategy: Flood the zones, attack flat zones, corner routes beat corners

**Vs. Cover 4 (Quarters):**
- Best: Curls, drags, crossing routes, outs (attack underneath)
- Strategy: Underneath routes with everyone deep, quick throws

**Hot Routes:**

Hot routes let you modify receiver routes at the line to exploit defensive weaknesses.

**How to Call Hot Routes (PlayStation):**
1. Press Triangle to enter hot route mode
2. Press the receiver's button (X, Square, Circle, R1, R2, L1)
3. Use the Right Stick to select the new route
4. Repeat for multiple receivers as needed

**Common Hot Routes and When to Use Them:**
- **Streak/Fly (up):** Use vs. single coverage or to stretch Cover 2 safeties deep
- **Curl (down-left):** Reliable option vs. zone, receiver sits in open area
- **Comeback (down):** Good vs. off-coverage corners, receiver breaks back to QB
- **Out/Quick Out (left):** Use vs. inside leverage or soft coverage, gets receiver to sideline
- **In/Slant (right):** Beats outside leverage and off-coverage, quick throw vs. blitz
- **Drag (down-right):** Shallow crosser, excellent vs. zone coverage and blitzes
- **Fade (up-left):** Back shoulder throw to sideline, good vs. Cover 2 corners
- **Post (up-right):** Attacks Cover 2 between safeties and beats Cover 3
- **Smart Route (tap):** AI adjusts route to beat coverage (useful but unpredictable)

**Hot Route Tips:**
- Hot route your checkdown RB to a flat or wheel route vs. blitz
- Convert outside receivers to streaks vs. Cover 2 to clear out safeties
- Use drags and slants vs. man coverage for quick separation
- Put slot receiver on out route vs. Cover 3 to attack the flat

**Audibles:**

Audibles allow you to completely change the play at the line based on what the defense shows.

**How to Call Audibles (PlayStation):**
- Press Square to bring up audible menu
- Use the D-pad or Left Stick to select a new play
- Press X to confirm
- The play clock keeps running, so audible quickly

**When to Audible:**
- **Run play called, defense shows run blitz:** Audible to a quick pass or screen
- **Pass play called, defense shows all-out blitz:** Audible to a run or quick slant/screen
- **Defense stacks one side:** Audible to run to the weak side
- **Cover 2 shell shown:** Audible to a play with seam routes or deep posts
- **Single-high safety (Cover 1/3):** Audible to plays with corner routes or outside throws
- **Goal line stand with heavy defense:** Audible to play action pass

**Pre-Play Audible Strategy:**
- Set 2-3 plays you like from each formation as audibles
- Have a run, short pass, and deep pass option available
- Use "check with me" strategy: call any play, then audible to what beats the defense
- Motion a receiver (L2/LT + receiver button) to diagnose man vs. zone before audibling

**Pass Protection:**

Proper pass protection prevents sacks and gives you time to make throws.

**ID the Mike (PlayStation: L1 → X → Move Indicator → X):**

Identifying the Mike linebacker tells your offensive line who to center their protection around. This is one of the most important pre-snap adjustments for pass protection.

**What IDing the Mike Does:**
- Designates which linebacker is the "Mike" (middle linebacker) for blocking purposes
- Centers your offensive line's protection scheme around that player
- Determines who gets blocked and who might come free
- Affects how your line picks up stunts and blitzes
- Overrides the game's automatic Mike identification

**How to ID the Mike:**

1. **Press L1** to open the pass protection adjustments menu
2. **Press X** to bring up the Mike indicator ("M" icon)
3. **Move the indicator** with Left Stick or D-Pad to the linebacker you want to designate
4. **Press X again** to confirm and lock in your selection
5. **Timing:** Do this pre-snap after reading the defense but before the snap
6. **Visual confirm:** You'll see "Mike" appear above the selected defender

**Which Linebacker to ID:**

The key is identifying the linebacker who represents the biggest threat or is most central to the defensive front.

- **Default protection:** The offensive line automatically IDs the middle linebacker
  - This works fine against standard defenses
  - May fail against unusual fronts or overload blitzes

- **Against overload blitzes (extra rushers from one side):**
  - ID the linebacker on the side with MORE rushers
  - This shifts protection toward the overload
  - Example: If defense shows 3 rushers on the right side, ID the right-side linebacker

- **Against A-gap blitzes (linebackers rushing through center-guard gaps):**
  - ID the linebacker who is showing blitz up the middle
  - Usually the inside linebacker who is creeping to the line
  - This keeps guards and center focused on interior threats

- **Against edge pressure:**
  - ID the linebacker on the side where you see edge pressure
  - Helps tackle and guard combo to that side
  - Protects your QB's blind side if pressure is coming from there

- **Against unusual fronts (under/over fronts, odd alignments):**
  - ID the linebacker who is most "central" to their defensive alignment
  - Usually the linebacker with the most space or in the middle of their formation
  - This balances your protection scheme

- **General rule:** ID the linebacker who is:
  - Most likely to blitz
  - In the center of the defensive front
  - Creating a blocking mismatch
  - On the side with more threats

**When to ID the Mike:**

**Always ID the Mike when you see:**
- Overload blitzes (more rushers on one side)
- A-gap blitzes (linebackers creeping at the A-gaps)
- Linebackers showing blitz pre-snap
- Unusual defensive fronts (under, over, bear)
- 3-4 defenses with 4 linebackers (game may misidentify)
- Safety blitzes (ID the linebacker nearest the blitzing safety)
- Goal line defense (lots of unusual alignments)

**Common situations:**
- **Cover 0 blitz:** ID the middle blitzer to center protection
- **Edge overload:** ID the linebacker on the overload side
- **Fire zone blitz:** ID the linebacker dropping into coverage (not the rusher)
- **Simulated pressure (showing blitz but dropping):** ID the actual rusher, not the faker

**When NOT to ID the Mike:**
- Standard defensive fronts (4-3, 3-4 base) - default is fine
- When you're running the ball (doesn't affect run blocking much)
- When you're calling a quick pass (ball out in under 2 seconds)
- Screen passes (you want them to blitz)

**ID the Mike Tips:**

- **Combine with slide protection:** ID the Mike + slide protection = powerful combo
  - ID the Mike on the overload side, then slide protection that direction
  - Ensures maximum blockers on the threat side

- **Watch pre-snap movement:**
  - If a linebacker creeps to the line, he's likely blitzing - ID him
  - If a linebacker backs up, he might be dropping - don't ID him

- **Read the numbers:**
  - Count potential rushers on each side
  - ID the Mike on the side with more rushers
  - Use slide protection to reinforce that side

- **Practice the timing:**
  - ID the Mike after reading the defense
  - Don't rush - you have time before snap
  - Make sure you ID the right linebacker (it's easy to aim incorrectly)

- **Communication with slide protection:**
  - If you ID the Mike to the right, consider sliding protection right
  - If you ID the Mike to the left, consider sliding protection left
  - This double-stacks protection where you need it

- **Against specific defenses:**
  - **3-4 defense:** ID the inside linebacker (not the outside)
  - **4-3 defense:** ID the middle linebacker (usually auto-correct)
  - **Nickel/Dime:** ID the linebacker, not the nickel/dime back
  - **Goal line:** ID the player most central to their front

- **Don't over-rely on it:**
  - ID the Mike helps but isn't a magic solution
  - Quick passes and hot routes beat blitzes better
  - Max protect is better vs. 6+ man blitzes
  - Sometimes throwing to the side they're blitzing from works (space opens up)

**Common Mistakes:**

- **IDing a defensive lineman:** Only ID linebackers, not D-linemen
- **IDing the wrong linebacker:** Aim carefully with Right Stick
- **Forgetting to slide protection:** ID the Mike works best with slide protection
- **IDing on run plays:** Doesn't help much, wastes time
- **IDing too late:** Do it pre-snap, not as clock runs out

**Example Scenarios:**

**Scenario 1: Right side overload blitz**
- Defense shows 3 rushers on right side (DE, OLB, Safety)
- ID the right outside linebacker (L1/LB + Right Stick right-up toward OLB)
- Slide protection right (L1/LB + Right Stick right)
- Result: Right tackle, right guard, and center all shift right, RB helps right

**Scenario 2: A-gap double blitz**
- Both inside linebackers showing blitz in A-gaps
- ID the linebacker on your QB's blind side (left side if right-handed QB)
- Keep RB in to block
- Result: Guards and center focus on interior, RB helps with free rusher

**Scenario 3: Safety blitz from deep**
- Safety creeping toward line, showing blitz
- ID the linebacker nearest to the blitzing safety
- Slide protection toward the safety's side
- Result: Offensive line shifts to handle both the linebacker and safety

**Advanced Tip:**
Against very good players who disguise blitzes, wait until the last moment to ID the Mike. They may show blitz then drop into coverage. Read their pre-snap movement, then ID the actual threat just before the snap.

**Slide Protection (L1/LB + Right Stick left/right):**
- Shifts entire offensive line protection left or right
- Use to handle overload blitzes coming from one side
- Slide toward the side with more pass rushers
- Leaves the opposite side more vulnerable, so throw quickly or to that side

**Max Protect (hot route RB and TE to block):**
- Keeps RB and/or TE in to block instead of running routes
- Gives you more time but fewer receiving options
- Use vs. heavy blitzes (6+ rushers)
- Press Triangle, select RB/TE, flick Right Stick down to block

**Running Back Block Assignments:**
- By default, RB checks for blitzers then releases to route
- Hot route to block for max protection vs. blitz
- Keep RB in on obvious passing downs when expecting pressure

**Blocking Tips:**
- Quick passes (under 2 seconds) beat most blitzes better than max protect
- Screen passes punish aggressive blitzing
- Empty backfield formations provide no pass protection help
- Tight ends provide better pass blocking than wide receivers

**RPOs (Run-Pass Options):**

RPOs give you the option to hand off or pass based on what the defense does. These plays are marked with "RPO" in the play call screen.

**How RPOs Work:**
- The play starts as a run
- You read a specific defender (usually a linebacker or safety)
- If the defender commits to the run, you pass
- If the defender drops into coverage, you hand off

**Executing RPOs (PlayStation):**
- **Hand off:** Do nothing, let the play develop as a run
- **Pass:** Press the receiver button before the handoff point
- **Decision time:** You have about 1 second to decide

**Reading the RPO:**
- Watch the "read key" defender (usually the edge defender or linebacker)
- **Defender crashes down to stop run:** Throw to the receiver
- **Defender stays back in coverage:** Hand off to the RB
- **Defender frozen/confused:** Either option works, choose based on numbers

**Types of RPOs:**
- **Bubble Screen RPO:** Read the outside linebacker. If he steps up, throw bubble screen to slot receiver
- **Slant RPO:** Read the linebacker. If he fills the run gap, throw slant behind him
- **Stick RPO:** Quick hitch route combined with inside run
- **Wheel RPO:** RB runs wheel route out of backfield, read the safety

**RPO Strategy:**
- RPOs are excellent vs. aggressive run-stopping defenses
- Work best with mobile QBs who can make quick decisions
- Use in 1st and 10 or 2nd and short situations
- Force defense to defend both run and pass simultaneously
- Don't stare down the receiver or defense will jump the route

### 3. Rushing Game

**Types of Run Plays:**

- **Inside Zone:** Running back follows blockers toward the inside gaps (A, B gaps). Offensive line zone blocks, creating lanes inside. Best vs. light boxes and good for 4-6 yards.
- **Outside Zone (Stretch):** RB runs toward the sideline, looking for cutback lanes. O-line blocks laterally to create running lanes outside. Great vs. aggressive defenses and slower linebackers.
- **Power/Power O:** Lead blocker (FB or pulling guard) leads through the hole. Physical, downhill running. Best in short yardage and vs. smaller defensive fronts.
- **Counter:** RB takes false step one direction, then cuts back opposite way with pulling blockers. Misdirection play that works well vs. over-pursuing defenses.
- **Draw:** Disguised as pass play, then RB takes delayed handoff. Excellent vs. blitzing defenses and pass-heavy situations.
- **Dive:** Quick handoff straight ahead. Used in short yardage and goal line situations.
- **Toss/Pitch:** QB tosses ball to RB running outside. Gets RB to edge quickly but vulnerable to pursuit.

**Running Back Moves (PlayStation Controls):**

- **Juke (Right Stick left/right):** Quick cut to make defenders miss. Use in open field with space to maneuver. More effective with high agility RBs.
- **Spin (Right Stick rotate):** 360-degree spin move. Use when defender is approaching from angle. Works best with space.
- **Stiff Arm (X button):** Push off defender with arm. Use on edge runs and when defender approaches from side. Most effective vs. smaller defenders.
- **Hurdle (Square button):** Jump over low defenders. Use vs. diving tackles and short defenders. Risk of fumble if hit in air.
- **Truck (Square when running into contact):** Lower shoulder and run through defender. Use with power backs vs. smaller defenders.
- **Dead Leg/Combo Moves (L2/LT + move):** Special moves for elite backs. More effective but limited by stamina.

**Reading Blocks:**

- **Pre-snap read:** Identify the defensive front and count defenders in the box
  - 6 or fewer in box = good for run
  - 7 in box = neutral
  - 8+ in box = difficult to run
- **Follow your blockers:** Watch for the lead blocker (FB, TE, or pulling guard) and run behind them
- **Find the hole:** Look for gaps opened by offensive line
  - If playside is clogged, cut back across the formation
  - Be patient for blocks to develop
  - Hit the hole with speed once you identify it
- **Get vertical:** After making one cut, get upfield quickly
- **Vision:** Use right stick subtly for quick cuts, don't overuse moves

**Rushing Tips:**
- Mix up run types to keep defense honest
- Run away from the 8+ man boxes
- Use play action after establishing the run
- Inside runs work better in 12/13 personnel
- Outside runs work better in 11/10 personnel
- Don't bounce every run outside - take what's blocked

### 4. Play-Calling

**Situational Football:**

Smart play-calling based on down, distance, field position, and game situation is crucial.

**By Down and Distance:**

- **1st and 10:**
  - Most flexible situation - can run or pass
  - Establish run game to set up play action
  - Use balanced formations (11 personnel)
  - Mix in safe passes to avoid 2nd and long

- **2nd and short (1-3 yards):**
  - High-percentage situation to get first down
  - Run with power formations (12/13 personnel)
  - Play action passes work well (defense expects run)
  - Don't get cute - take the easy yards

- **2nd and medium (4-7 yards):**
  - Still balanced run/pass situation
  - Use runs to set up manageable 3rd down
  - Quick/intermediate passes are safe options
  - Avoid negative plays at all costs

- **2nd and long (8+ yards):**
  - Pass-heavy situation
  - Consider draw or screen to set up 3rd down
  - Deep shots are risky - focus on getting half the yards back
  - Don't force throws into coverage

- **3rd and short (1-3 yards):**
  - Must convert - use power run or QB sneak
  - Play action pass with quick option works
  - Shotgun runs give better vision
  - Don't run into stacked boxes (8+ defenders)

- **3rd and medium (4-7 yards):**
  - Passing down - use bunch formations and pick plays
  - Slants, curls, and out routes get first down yardage
  - Have checkdown available at first down marker
  - Scramble for first if open

- **3rd and long (8+ yards):**
  - Clear passing down - use 4-5 receiver sets
  - Draw plays can catch aggressive defenses
  - Screen passes use their aggression against them
  - Don't take sacks - throw it away if needed

- **4th down:**
  - Consider punting unless in opponent territory or late in game
  - Short yardage (1-2 yards): Go for it in plus territory
  - Trust your best plays - defense knows situation too

**Red Zone Offense (Inside 20 yard line):**

- **Field shrinks:** Less space for deep routes, defense plays tighter
- **Formation tips:** Use 12/13 personnel for power, or bunch formations for picks
- **High-percentage plays:** Fades, slants, quick outs, power runs
- **Goal line (inside 5):** QB sneak, power runs, or play action rollout
- **Red zone mistakes to avoid:** Don't force throws, protect the ball, take field goal if needed

**Clock Management:**

- **Preserving clock (when leading late):**
  - Run the ball to keep clock moving
  - Use middle of field to keep clock running
  - Snap ball with 1-5 seconds left on play clock
  - Don't score too quickly if maintaining lead

- **Two-minute drill (when trailing):**
  - Use timeouts wisely - save at least one for field goal
  - Throw to sidelines to stop clock
  - Use Hurry-Up offense (press up on D-pad)
  - Spike the ball (audible to spike) if clock running with no timeouts
  - Know when to settle for field goal vs. touchdown
  - Completions in middle of field require timeout to stop clock

- **Running out clock (4-minute drill when winning):**
  - Run between the tackles
  - Let play clock run to 1 second before snapping
  - QB sneak on short yardage to keep clock running
  - Don't pass unless necessary for first down
  - Force opponent to use their timeouts

**Game Script Strategy:**

- **When losing:** More aggressive, more passing, take calculated risks
- **When winning:** Conservative, run the ball, protect the lead, no turnovers
- **Close game:** Stick to your strengths, don't abandon run game, stay balanced
- **Blowout (winning big):** Run clock, use backups, simple plays
- **Blowout (losing big):** Work on practice/different plays, develop younger players (Franchise)
