# Franchise Mode Guide

This guide provides a comprehensive roadmap for building a dynasty in Madden's Franchise Mode. Franchise Mode is the career mode where you take control of an NFL team and build a championship organization over multiple seasons. You'll manage the roster, navigate the salary cap, scout and draft players, develop talent, and make the strategic decisions that turn a struggling franchise into a dynasty. This guide covers everything from choosing your team and initial setup through managing multiple seasons and building sustained success.

## Key Concepts

### 1. Starting Your Franchise

**Choosing Your Role:**

- **Coach:** Focus purely on football - roster management, play-calling, game planning
  - No financial decisions or stadium management
  - Best for players who want to focus on winning games
  - Can be fired if you don't meet owner expectations

- **Owner:** Control everything - football operations plus business decisions
  - Manage finances, set ticket prices, relocate team, upgrade stadium
  - More complex but full control
  - Can't be fired (you own the team)
  - Best for players who want complete franchise control

- **Player:** Control one player's career through their perspective
  - Different experience - focuses on individual development
  - Not covered in this guide (this guide focuses on Coach/Owner modes)

**Choosing a Team:**

**Contender (85+ Overall Rating):**
- Strong roster, ready to compete now
- Less rebuilding needed
- Higher expectations - must win quickly
- Good for learning franchise mechanics
- Challenge: Salary cap is usually tight, limited draft capital
- Examples: Chiefs, 49ers, Bills (varies by Madden version)

**Rebuilder (75-84 Overall Rating):**
- Mediocre roster with holes
- 2-3 year rebuild timeline
- More cap space and draft picks
- Balanced challenge - not too easy or hard
- Good for experiencing full roster building
- Examples: Middle-tier teams with aging rosters

**Full Rebuild (Under 75 Overall Rating):**
- Poor roster, many positions need upgrades
- 3-5 year rebuild required
- Maximum cap space and high draft picks
- Most challenging but most rewarding
- Best for experienced franchise players
- Complete control to build your vision

**Factors to Consider When Choosing:**
1. **Current roster strength** - Check overall ratings and depth chart
2. **Salary cap space** - More space = more flexibility
3. **Draft capital** - Number and quality of draft picks
4. **Young talent** - Teams with young stars are easier to build around
5. **Quarterback situation** - Hardest position to fix, crucial for success
6. **Division competition** - Easier to make playoffs in weaker divisions

**League Settings:**

**Gameplay Settings:**
- **Difficulty:** Rookie (easiest) to All-Madden (hardest)
  - Recommendation: Start on Pro, increase as you improve
- **Game Style:** Simulation (realistic) vs. Arcade (faster)
  - Recommendation: Simulation for franchise realism

**Franchise Settings:**
- **Salary Cap:** On (realistic) or Off (unlimited spending)
  - Recommendation: Keep ON for authentic experience
- **Trade Difficulty:** Easy, Normal, Hard
  - Normal recommended - prevents unrealistic trades
- **Injuries:** On/Off and frequency
  - Recommendation: On with default frequency
- **Player Progression:** Normal, Accelerated, Slow
  - Normal recommended for realistic development
- **Draft Class Quality:** Auto-generated or imported
  - Auto-generated is standard
- **Commissioner Mode:** Access to edit rosters/settings mid-franchise
  - Use sparingly to maintain realism

**Preseason Setup:**

Before your first game:
1. **Review depth chart** - Ensure best players are starting
2. **Check scheme fit** - Players perform better in matching schemes
3. **Set practice intensity** - Balance development vs. injury risk
4. **Choose weekly training focus** - Offense, Defense, or Special Teams
5. **Review playbook** - Ensure it matches your style

### 2. Team Management

**Roster Building:**

Building a championship roster requires smart trading, free agency, drafting, and salary cap management.

**Trading:**

**Understanding Trade Value:**
- Every player and draft pick has a trade value (shown in trade screen)
- Trade must be relatively equal in total value to be accepted
- Higher overall rating = higher value
- Position scarcity matters (QB, LT, CB, EDGE have premium value)
- Age matters - young players worth more than old players at same rating
- Contract matters - big contracts lower trade value

**Trade Strategy:**
- **Trading Away:** Get maximum value for aging stars before they decline
  - Best time: Player is 28-30, still has high rating but will decline soon
  - Target: Young players or high draft picks
  - Avoid: Holding onto aging players until value plummets

- **Trading For:** Acquire players to fill immediate needs
  - Target: Young players (23-26) with room to grow
  - Look for: Players on rookie contracts (cheap)
  - Avoid: Overpaying for aging veterans unless you're in win-now mode

- **Draft Pick Trading:**
  - Moving up: Costs exponentially more the higher you go (use draft value chart)
  - Moving down: Accumulate picks by trading back
  - Future picks: Worth less than current year picks
  - Strategy: Trade down to accumulate picks if rebuilding, trade up for elite talent if contending

**Trade Tips:**
- Use "Trade Finder" to see what teams want for specific players
- Don't trade away all your draft picks - you need cheap rookie contracts
- Trade deadline (Week 8) - last chance to make trades for current season
- CPU teams value picks highly - harder to acquire picks than players
- Package deals work well (multiple low-value players for one high-value player)

**Salary Cap Management:**

**Understanding the Salary Cap:**
- Each team has a salary cap limit (approximately $225M, varies by Madden version)
- Must stay under the cap at all times
- Cap increases slightly each year
- Dead money from cut players still counts against cap

**Contract Basics:**
- **Contract Length:** 1-7 years (most common: 3-5 years)
- **Salary:** Annual amount paid to player
- **Signing Bonus:** Upfront money, spread across contract years for cap purposes
- **Guarantees:** Money player gets even if cut
- **Cap Hit:** Salary + prorated bonus = total cap charge for that year

**Cap Management Strategies:**

**Restructuring Contracts:**
- Converts salary into bonus, reducing current year cap hit
- Spreads cap hit into future years
- Use when: Need immediate cap space
- Risk: Creates future cap problems ("kicking the can down the road")

**Cutting Players:**
- **Pre-June 1 Cut:** All dead money hits immediately
- **Post-June 1 Cut:** Dead money spread over 2 years
- Cut players with low/no guarantees to free cap space
- Painful but necessary when rebuilding or in cap trouble

**Smart Signing:**
- **Front-load contracts:** Pay more in Year 1-2 when you have cap space
- **Short contracts for older players:** 1-2 years for 30+ age players
- **Long contracts for young stars:** Lock in before they get expensive
- **Avoid guarantees when possible:** Gives flexibility to cut if needed

**Positional Value and Spending:**
- **Must pay premium:** QB, LT, CB, EDGE rusher, WR1
- **Can find value:** RB, TE, interior O-line, LB, Safety
- **Draft and develop:** Positions where rookies can contribute immediately
- **Free agency:** Fill immediate holes with veterans

**Cap Hell and Recovery:**
If you're over the cap or have minimal space:
1. Cut aging veterans with low dead money
2. Trade expensive players for picks
3. Restructure key players (QB, star players)
4. Let free agents walk
5. Draft heavily for 2-3 years to get cheap talent
6. Avoid: Signing expensive free agents until cap is healthy

**Signing and Releasing Players:**

**Signing Free Agents:**
- Available during free agency period (offseason)
- Can sign during season if players are available
- Must have cap space for their contract
- Use "Sign Free Agent" menu to browse available players
- Filter by position and overall rating

**Releasing Players:**
- Cuts player from roster immediately
- Dead money charges against cap based on guarantees
- Do this to: Free up cap space, make room for better players, cut underperformers
- Timing matters: Post-June 1 cuts spread cap hit over 2 years

**Practice Squad:**
- Up to 16 players can be on practice squad
- Don't count against active roster (53 players)
- Can be signed by other teams
- Good for: Developing young players, keeping depth

**Player Development:**

Developing your players is crucial for long-term success. Young players can improve dramatically with proper training.

**Development Traits:**

Every player has a development trait that affects how quickly they improve:
- **Star:** Fastest development, gains XP quickly (rare)
- **Superstar:** Very fast development, elite potential
- **X-Factor:** Elite development, can unlock special abilities
- **Normal:** Standard development rate (most common)
- **Impact:** Slower development

**Weekly Training:**

Each week during the season, you can set training focus:
- **Offensive Focus:** Your offensive players gain more XP
- **Defensive Focus:** Your defensive players gain more XP
- **Special Teams Focus:** Kicker, Punter, returners gain more XP
- **Balanced:** Everyone gains XP but less than focused training

**Recommendation:** Focus on your weakest unit or unit facing toughest opponent

**Player XP and Upgrades:**

- Players earn XP (experience points) each week based on:
  - Performance in games (stats, big plays)
  - Weekly training focus
  - Practice performance
  - Development trait
- XP is used to upgrade individual attributes (speed, catching, tackle, etc.)
- Higher attributes = higher overall rating
- Focus upgrades on: Core attributes for each position (speed for WR, tackle for LB, etc.)

**Progression and Regression:**

**Progression (Players Getting Better):**
- Young players (under 26) improve fastest
- Peak years: 26-29 for most positions
- Keep playing time high for young players to maximize development
- Starters develop faster than backups

**Regression (Players Getting Worse):**
- Begins around age 30 for most positions
- Speed and acceleration decline first
- Awareness and intelligence stats stay high
- QB, K, P can play effectively into mid-30s
- RB and CB decline fastest (usually done by 30-31)

**Age Guidelines by Position:**
- **Prime years (draft/sign):** 23-27
- **Veteran contributors:** 28-30
- **Decline phase:** 31+
- **Exceptions:** QB (prime 27-33), K/P (prime 25-35)

**Development Tips:**

1. **Start young players** - They need game reps to develop
2. **Focus training on weak side** - Balance your team
3. **Invest in high development traits** - Star/Superstar/X-Factor players are worth more
4. **Trade aging veterans before regression** - Get value while they're still good
5. **Don't overpay old players** - They'll decline and not justify the cost
6. **Build through the draft** - Young cheap talent is key to sustained success

### 3. Scouting and the NFL Draft

**Scouting:**

Scouting is how you evaluate college players before the draft. Better scouting = better draft picks.

**Scouting System:**

- You have a pool of scouting points to spend each week (usually 1000-1500)
- Scouts unlock information about prospects over time
- Information unlocked progresses: Position → Attributes → Overall Rating → Full Profile
- More points spent on a player = more information revealed

**Scout Allocation Strategies:**

**Focus Scouting (Recommended for most):**
- Spend all points on 1-2 positions of need
- Fully scout top 15-20 prospects at those positions
- Know exactly who to pick for your needs
- Best for: Targeted team building

**Spread Scouting:**
- Spend points across multiple positions
- Less info per player, but more players scouted
- Good for identifying value in later rounds
- Best for: When you have many needs

**Top-Heavy Scouting:**
- Scout only players projected in rounds 1-3
- Ignore late-round prospects
- Maximizes info on high-impact players
- Best for: Contending teams picking late

**Scout Allocation Tips:**
1. **Scout positions of need first** - Don't waste points on positions you don't need
2. **Scout QB, LT, EDGE, CB heavily** - Premium positions worth extra scouting
3. **Regional scouts** - Each scout has a region, assign to their region for bonus
4. **Combine/Pro Day** - Reveals physical stats (speed, strength, jump) automatically
5. **Don't over-scout** - Once you have top 10-15 players at position scouted, that's enough

**Reading Scouting Reports:**

**Grade System:**
- **A Grade (90-99):** Elite prospect, franchise player potential
- **B Grade (80-89):** Great prospect, starter quality
- **C Grade (70-79):** Good prospect, solid contributor
- **D Grade (60-69):** Developmental, backup quality
- **F Grade (Below 60):** Unlikely to make roster

**Development Traits (Most Important):**
- X-Factor > Superstar > Star > Normal
- A Normal development 85 overall < Star development 78 overall
- Development trait is more valuable than current rating for young players

**Boom or Bust:**
- Some prospects have high variance
- Could be great or could bust
- Indicated by wide rating range (e.g., 72-88 OVR)
- Risky picks - avoid unless late round value

**The NFL Draft:**

The draft is where you acquire cheap young talent to build your roster.

**Draft Strategy:**

**Best Player Available (BPA):**
- Draft highest-rated player regardless of position
- Trust that talent wins
- Best for: Rebuilding teams with many needs
- Advantage: Get best value
- Disadvantage: Might not fill immediate needs

**Draft for Need:**
- Target specific positions your team lacks
- Fill roster holes
- Best for: Contending teams with specific weaknesses
- Advantage: Address immediate problems
- Disadvantage: Might reach for lesser players

**Balanced Approach (Recommended):**
- Draft BPA in rounds 1-2
- Draft for need in rounds 3-7
- Gets best talent early, fills depth late

**Positional Value by Round:**

**Round 1-2 (Premium Picks):**
- **Must draft:** QB, LT, EDGE, CB, WR
- These positions have highest impact and value
- Don't draft: RB, TE, interior OL, LB, S (can find in later rounds)
- Exception: Generational talent at any position

**Round 3-4 (Starter Quality):**
- **Good value:** WR, OL, DL, LB, S
- Find starting-caliber players
- Fill need positions

**Round 5-7 (Depth and Development):**
- **Target:** Developmental players with Star/Superstar traits
- Swing for upside
- Fill practice squad
- Special teams contributors

**Draft Day Tactics:**

**Trading Up:**
- Cost: Future picks or multiple current picks
- Do it when: Franchise QB available, or perfect fit player falls
- Don't do it: For non-premium positions or marginal upgrades
- Rule: Only trade up for players with Star+ development

**Trading Down:**
- Gain: Extra picks, move to future drafts
- Do it when: No one you love at current pick
- Best for: Rebuilding teams accumulating assets
- Sweet spot: Trade out of top 10 to 15-20, gain 2nd/3rd round picks

**Draft Tips:**

1. **QB is king** - If you don't have a franchise QB, prioritize finding one
2. **Development > Overall** - 75 OVR Superstar > 82 OVR Normal
3. **Don't reach for need** - Desperation leads to busts
4. **Speed matters** - Fast players (90+ speed) have higher ceilings
5. **Build the trenches** - OL and DL win championships
6. **Compensatory picks** - Gained when you lose free agents (Round 3-7)
7. **Mock draft** - Shows projected picks, but actual draft varies
8. **Age matters** - Some prospects enter draft at 23-24 (less development time)

**Finding Gems and Avoiding Busts:**

**Gems (Late-Round Steals):**
- Look for: High development trait + low overall
- Target: Rounds 4-7 players with Star/Superstar development
- These players develop into stars on cheap contracts
- Physical traits: Speed, height, weight can't be developed - draft it
- Best positions for gems: WR, RB, S, OL (productive even at lower ratings)

**Busts (Avoiding Bad Picks):**
- Red flags: Boom/Bust rating, Normal development in Round 1-2
- Avoid: Old prospects (23+), injury-prone players
- Don't draft: Positions you can sign in free agency cheaper (RB, TE)
- Research: Check scouted attributes, not just overall rating

### 4. The Season and Off-season

**In-Season Management:**

**Weekly Tasks:**

Each week during the season, manage these tasks:

1. **Set Gameplan:**
   - Adjust offensive and defensive focus based on opponent
   - Example: If opponent has weak pass defense, focus on passing
   - Set run/pass balance, blitz frequency, etc.

2. **Practice Intensity:**
   - **Light:** Low injury risk, minimal development
   - **Normal:** Balanced risk/reward (recommended)
   - **Intense:** High development, higher injury risk
   - Use Light before playoffs or with injured roster
   - Use Intense early season with healthy roster

3. **Training Focus:**
   - Choose Offense, Defense, or Special Teams for XP bonus
   - Focus on struggling unit or unit facing tough matchup

4. **Depth Chart Review:**
   - Adjust starters if players are injured or underperforming
   - Check for auto-generated changes (game sometimes moves players)
   - Ensure backups are appropriate

5. **Injury Report:**
   - Check player health status
   - Out/Doubtful/Questionable/Probable
   - Adjust depth chart for injured starters

**Sim vs. Play:**

- **Play games** to: Control outcomes, develop user skills, key divisional games
- **Sim games** to: Save time, advance through season faster
- **Strategy:** Play tough opponents and divisional games, sim easy wins

**Free Agency (Off-season and In-Season):**

Free agency is where you sign players who aren't on a team.

**Free Agency Period (Main off-season period):**

Occurs after the draft, before next season starts:

1. **Re-sign your own players:**
   - Your players with expiring contracts become free agents
   - You get first chance to re-sign them
   - Priority: Re-sign young stars before they hit open market
   - Let go: Aging veterans, overpaid players, replaceable depth

2. **Free Agent Bidding:**
   - Other teams' free agents are available
   - Make offers (contract length, salary, bonus)
   - Player evaluates all offers and chooses
   - Factors: Money, team quality, role, scheme fit

3. **Contract Negotiations:**
   - Player has asking price (shown in FA menu)
   - You can offer at, below, or above asking price
   - Below asking: Saves cap but less likely to sign
   - Above asking: More likely to sign but costs more
   - Signing bonus: One-time payment, spreads cap hit

**Free Agency Strategy:**

**Who to Sign:**
- **Immediate needs:** Fill holes in your roster
- **Value signings:** Good players asking for cheap deals
- **Young players (25-27):** Still developing, multi-year value
- **Scheme fits:** Players who fit your offensive/defensive scheme

**Who to Avoid:**
- **Old veterans (31+):** Will decline, not worth multi-year deals
- **Overpaid players:** Don't pay above value just to fill need
- **Redundant positions:** Don't sign where you have depth
- **Injury-prone:** High risk of missing games

**Free Agency Tips:**

1. **Set budget** - Know your cap space before bidding
2. **Don't overspend** - Cheap free agents + draft picks > expensive FAs
3. **1-2 year deals for old players** - Avoid long commitments to declining players
4. **Prioritize premium positions** - QB, LT, EDGE, CB worth paying
5. **Compensatory picks** - Letting FAs walk gets you draft picks next year

**Off-Season Timeline:**

**Week 1-2: Re-sign Period**
- Exclusive window to re-sign your pending free agents
- Make offers to players you want to keep
- Let others walk to save cap space

**Week 3-5: Free Agency**
- All free agents available
- Make offers, players sign throughout period
- Front-load signings early to get best players

**Week 6-8: Post-Free Agency**
- Sign remaining free agents
- Fill depth chart holes
- Prepare for draft

**Week 9: NFL Draft**
- 7 rounds, draft your rookies
- Make trades during draft

**Week 10-12: Post-Draft**
- Sign undrafted free agents
- Finalize 90-man roster
- Set training camp depth chart

**Week 13: Preseason Begins**
- 4 preseason games
- Evaluate rookies and roster battles
- Make final cuts from 90 to 53 players

**Off-Season Priorities:**

1. **Address biggest needs** - Fill holes from last season
2. **Get younger** - Trade/release aging players, add youth
3. **Manage the cap** - Stay under cap, create space for future
4. **Build through draft** - Draft is your foundation
5. **Develop young players** - Set up for future success

### 5. Injuries and Roster Management

**Managing Injuries:**

Injuries are part of football and significantly impact your season. Managing them properly is crucial.

**Injury Types:**

- **Out (4+ weeks):** Serious injury, player unavailable for extended time
- **Injured Reserve (IR):** Season-ending injury, frees roster spot
- **Doubtful (1-3 weeks):** Unlikely to play this week
- **Questionable:** Might play, check before game
- **Probable:** Will likely play

**Injured Reserve (IR):**

- Players with season-ending injuries go on IR
- Frees up active roster spot (53-man limit)
- Player cannot return same season (in most Madden versions)
- **When to use:** Serious injuries that will keep player out 6+ weeks
- **Strategy:** Use IR to make room for healthy players, especially late in season

**Managing Injured Rosters:**

**Short-term injuries (1-3 weeks):**
- Keep player on active roster if you have depth
- Promote practice squad player temporarily
- Sign free agent if position is thin

**Long-term injuries (4+ weeks):**
- Place on IR to free roster spot
- Make trade for replacement
- Adjust gameplan to account for missing player
- Develop backup who will fill in

**Preventing Injuries:**

- **Light practice intensity** during playoffs or when roster is banged up
- **Rest starters** in sim games or blowouts
- **Depth matters** - Have quality backups at key positions

**Roster Management:**

**53-Man Active Roster:**
- Maximum players on active roster
- All must fit under salary cap
- Players can play in games

**Practice Squad (16 players):**
- Developmental players
- Don't count against cap or active roster
- Can be signed by other teams
- Good for stashing young talent

**Preseason Roster Cuts:**
- Start training camp with 90 players
- Must cut down to 53 before Week 1
- Keep: Best 53 players who fit under cap
- Cut: Veterans you don't need, failed draft picks
- Practice Squad: Young developmental players

**Depth Chart Management:**

- **Starters:** Your best 22 players (11 offense, 11 defense)
- **Backups:** Next-best players at each position
- **Third-string:** Emergency depth
- **Special Teams:** Dedicate spots for coverage/return specialists

**Roster Construction Guidelines:**

**Offensive Positions (approximately 25 players):**
- QB: 2-3 (1 starter, 1 backup, maybe developmental 3rd)
- RB: 3-4 (1-2 starters, backups, FB if you use one)
- WR: 5-6 (3 starters, quality depth)
- TE: 2-3 (1-2 starters, backup)
- OL: 8-9 (5 starters, quality backups at each position)

**Defensive Positions (approximately 25 players):**
- DL: 6-8 (depends on 3-4 vs 4-3, need rotation)
- LB: 6-8 (3-4 starters depending on scheme, backups)
- CB: 5-6 (2 starters, nickel corner, depth)
- S: 4-5 (2 starters, quality backups)

**Special Teams (approximately 3 players):**
- K: 1 (kicker)
- P: 1 (punter)
- LS: 0-1 (long snapper, optional in Madden)

### 6. Dynasty Building Strategy

**Building a Sustained Winner:**

True success in Franchise Mode isn't one championship - it's sustained excellence over 5-10 seasons.

**Year 1: Foundation**

**If Contender:**
- Win now while roster is good
- Make win-now trades (future picks for current help)
- Sign short-term free agents to fill holes
- Draft best player available

**If Rebuilder:**
- Trade aging veterans for picks
- Accumulate draft capital (trade down, trade players)
- Sign young free agents to team-friendly deals
- Tank for high draft picks
- Build through draft

**Year 2-3: Building Phase**

- Draft picks from Year 1 are developing
- Young players replacing aging veterans
- Identify your core players (QB, LT, EDGE, CB, WR)
- Re-sign young core before they become expensive
- Continue drafting well
- Competing for playoffs

**Year 4-5: Contention Window**

- Core players in prime (ages 26-29)
- Rookie contracts expiring - cap gets tighter
- Win-now mentality
- Trade picks for proven players
- Sign key free agents
- Deep playoff runs

**Year 6+: Retooling**

- Core players aging (30+)
- Salary cap tight from re-signings
- Trade aging stars for picks before they decline
- Restock through draft
- Begin next cycle
- Avoid cap hell

**Dynasty Building Principles:**

1. **Always draft well** - Your foundation every year
2. **Churn the bottom of roster** - Constantly upgrade depth
3. **Extend core players early** - Lock in before they become expensive
4. **Don't overpay veterans** - Let aging players walk
5. **Comp picks matter** - Letting FAs walk gets you draft picks
6. **Avoid cap hell** - Don't restructure into oblivion
7. **Stay young** - Average team age should be 25-27
8. **Have a QB** - Nothing matters without franchise QB
9. **Build the trenches** - OL and DL are foundation
10. **Patience pays** - Don't panic-trade picks or overspend

**Avoiding Common Mistakes:**

**Mistake: Trading away all your picks**
- Fix: Always keep your 1st and 2nd round picks
- Never trade more than 2 years of picks

**Mistake: Overpaying in free agency**
- Fix: Set budget, stick to it
- Use draft as primary talent source

**Mistake: Keeping aging players too long**
- Fix: Trade before age 30, get value while you can
- Exception: QB, elite players can play to 32-33

**Mistake: Ignoring the salary cap**
- Fix: Track cap space, plan ahead
- Don't restructure unless absolutely necessary

**Mistake: Not developing young players**
- Fix: Play young backups in blowouts
- Use training focus on young players
- Give reps to develop

**Championship Recipe:**

1. **Franchise QB** (most important)
2. **Elite pass rush** (2+ EDGE rushers 85+ OVR)
3. **Shutdown corner** (lockdown CB 88+ OVR)
4. **Protect the QB** (quality OL, especially LT)
5. **Playmakers** (WR, RB, LB who make plays)
6. **Depth** (injuries will happen, need quality backups)
7. **Coaching** (your play-calling and management)

**Building a dynasty requires patience, discipline, and smart decision-making across multiple seasons. Follow these principles and you'll build a perennial contender.**
