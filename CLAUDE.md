# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a markdown-based wiki guide for playing Madden football games on PlayStation console, specifically focused on Franchise Mode. The guide is structured as a collection of interlinked markdown documents covering different aspects of gameplay.

## Repository Structure

The repository contains standalone markdown files organized by topic:

- **index.md**: Main landing page with navigation to all sections
- **offense.md**: Offensive strategies (formations, passing/rushing game, play-calling)
- **defense.md**: Defensive strategies (formations, coverage shells, blitzing, run defense)
- **special-teams.md**: Kicking, punting, returns, and trick plays
- **franchise-mode.md**: Team management, roster building, scouting, drafts, off-season
- **GEMINI.md**: Project configuration file defining the wiki format and scope

## Content Structure

All guide pages follow a consistent structure:
1. Page title (H1)
2. Introduction paragraph
3. Key Concepts section with numbered subsections (H3)
4. Bullet points for detailed mechanics and strategies

## Working with Content

When editing or adding content:

- This is a **guide/documentation project**, not a software project - there are no build, test, or lint commands
- Content is pure markdown with no build toolchain or dependencies
- Maintain the existing hierarchical structure: formations → mechanics → strategies
- Keep the PlayStation console perspective throughout all content
- Cross-reference related topics using relative markdown links (e.g., `[Defense](./defense.md)`)
- Focus on practical, actionable gameplay advice rather than theoretical concepts

## Content Guidelines from GEMINI.md

- Format: Wiki-style pages in markdown
- Scope: Franchise mode gameplay covering offensive/defensive play calling, reading defenses, hot routes, audibles, pass protection, coverages, pre/post-snap reads, roster management, injuries, Injured Reserve, playbooks
- Audience: PlayStation console players
