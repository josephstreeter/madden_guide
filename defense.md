# Defensive Guide

This guide explains how to stop the opponent's offense and create turnovers. Mastering defense requires understanding formations and personnel, calling the right coverage, executing effective blitzes, controlling user defenders, making pre-snap adjustments, and reading offensive plays. This guide will teach you how to shut down the pass and run, pressure the quarterback, create turnovers, and dominate on defense.

## Key Concepts

### 1. Formations

**Base Defensive Fronts:**

- **4-3 Defense** - 4 down linemen, 3 linebackers, 4 defensive backs
  - Strong against the run with 4 linemen and 3 LBs in the box
  - Vulnerable to spread offenses with multiple receivers
  - Best vs. 12/13 personnel (run-heavy offenses)
  - Provides 7 defenders in the box for run support

- **3-4 Defense** - 3 down linemen, 4 linebackers, 4 defensive backs
  - Versatile - can blitz from multiple angles with 4 LBs
  - Outside linebackers can rush or drop into coverage
  - Good against both run and pass
  - Requires strong, space-eating nose tackle
  - Best vs. balanced offenses

**Situational Packages:**

- **Nickel (5 DBs)** - Base defense in modern Madden
  - Replaces 1 linebacker with 5th DB (nickel corner)
  - Balanced package for modern offenses
  - Stops both run and pass reasonably well
  - Use vs. 11 personnel (most common offensive package)
  - Default choice in most situations

- **Dime (6 DBs)** - Obvious passing situations
  - Replaces 2 linebackers with extra DBs
  - Better pass coverage, weaker vs. run
  - Use on 3rd and long (7+ yards)
  - Use vs. 10 personnel (4 WR sets)
  - Vulnerable to draw plays and screens

- **Quarter (7 DBs)** - Prevent/deep passing situations
  - Maximum pass coverage with 7 DBs
  - Very weak against the run
  - Use in obvious passing downs and prevent situations
  - Use in two-minute drill when opponent must throw
  - Easily exploited by runs

- **Goal Line** - Heavy package for short yardage
  - Extra defensive linemen, fewer DBs
  - Maximum run stopping power
  - Use inside your own 5-yard line on defense
  - Use on 4th and short when opponent must run
  - Vulnerable to play action and quick passes

**Defensive Front Alignments:**

Understanding defensive front alignments helps you counter specific offensive formations and plays. Front alignments determine how your defensive linemen position themselves relative to offensive blockers.

**Technique Numbers:**

Defensive line alignments use technique numbers to describe positioning:
- **0 technique:** Head up on center
- **1 technique:** Inside shoulder of guard (A gap)
- **2/2i technique:** Head up or inside shoulder of guard
- **3 technique:** Outside shoulder of guard (B gap)
- **4/4i technique:** Head up or inside shoulder of tackle
- **5 technique:** Outside shoulder of tackle (C gap)
- **6 technique:** Head up on tight end
- **7 technique:** Inside shoulder of tight end
- **9 technique:** Wide outside the tight end (wide-9)

**Even Fronts (4-3 Based):**

Even fronts use 4 down linemen (2 DEs, 2 DTs).

- **Standard 4-3 Alignment:**
  - DTs aligned in 3-technique (outside shoulder of guards)
  - DEs aligned in 5-technique or wider (outside shoulder of tackles)
  - Balanced alignment, equal gaps on both sides
  - **Strengths:** Balanced against run and pass, natural pass rush lanes, good gap integrity
  - **Weaknesses:** Can be outflanked by outside runs, vulnerable to double teams on DTs
  - **When to use:** Balanced offensive formations, default front against 11 or 12 personnel

- **Over Front:**
  - Strong-side DE aligns inside (4i-technique on tackle's inside shoulder)
  - Strong-side DT aligns in 3-technique
  - Weak-side DT aligns in 1-technique (inside shoulder of guard)
  - Weak-side DE aligns in 5-technique or wider
  - Shifts strength to the strong side (typically to the tight end side)
  - **Strengths:** Strong-side power, controls strong-side run game, extra gap player strong side
  - **Weaknesses:** Vulnerable to weak-side runs, can be exploited by formations away from strength
  - **When to use:** Against strong formations (tight end + running back to one side), when opponent runs to tight end side, vs. power run game

- **Under Front:**
  - Weak-side DE in 5-technique (outside shoulder of tackle)
  - Weak-side DT in 3-technique (outside shoulder of guard)
  - Strong-side DT in 1-technique (inside shoulder of guard)
  - Strong-side DE in 5-technique or heads up on tight end
  - Shifts strength away from tight end side
  - **Strengths:** Better pass rush from weak side, prevents offense from running away from tight end, confuses blocking schemes
  - **Weaknesses:** Strong-side run can be vulnerable, requires disciplined linebackers
  - **When to use:** Against pass-heavy offenses, when opponent expects over front, to create favorable pass rush matchups

- **Bear Front (46 Defense variant):**
  - Both DTs head up on guards (2-technique or 0-technique)
  - DEs head up or outside of tackles
  - Loads up the middle, 8 in the box
  - **Strengths:** Dominant vs. inside run, powerful short yardage, creates A-gap pressure
  - **Weaknesses:** Vulnerable to outside runs, weak against spread formations, exploited by quick passes
  - **When to use:** Goal line situations, short yardage (3rd/4th and 1), vs. power run teams

**Odd Fronts (3-4 Based):**

Odd fronts use 3 down linemen (2 DEs, 1 NT).

- **Standard 3-4 Alignment:**
  - Nose tackle head up on center (0-technique)
  - DEs aligned in 5-technique (outside shoulder of tackles)
  - 4 linebackers fill gaps and provide versatility
  - **Strengths:** Versatile blitz options, disguises pressure, good vs. run and pass, can shift to even front
  - **Weaknesses:** Requires elite nose tackle, linebackers must be sound vs. run, can be stressed by inside zone runs
  - **When to use:** When you have strong linebackers, to disguise blitzes, against balanced offenses

- **3-4 Over/Under:**
  - Over: Nose tackle shades to strong-side A gap (1-technique), DE to that side in 4i/5
  - Under: Nose tackle shades to weak-side A gap (1-technique)
  - Shifts the front to create mismatches
  - **Strengths:** Creates 2-on-1 blocking conflicts, controls gaps on shift side
  - **Weaknesses:** Backside can be vulnerable, requires nose tackle to play in space
  - **When to use:** To overload one side, based on offensive formation strength, to create specific blitz angles

- **3-3 Stack:**
  - 3 down linemen (like 3-4), but only 3 linebackers stacked behind them
  - Extra DB replacing a linebacker (hybrid between 3-4 and Nickel)
  - **Strengths:** Fast and versatile, good against spread offenses, can still stop the run
  - **Weaknesses:** Lighter box, vulnerable to power run if not careful
  - **When to use:** Against 11 personnel spread offenses, vs. athletic quarterbacks, when you need speed

**Choosing Your Front:**

**Against Run-Heavy Offenses:**
- Use even fronts (4-3) for more beef on the line
- Bear front for short yardage and power formations
- Over front to control tight end side
- Stack the box with 8+ defenders

**Against Pass-Heavy Offenses:**
- Under front creates better pass rush matchups
- Odd fronts (3-4) provide blitz disguise
- 3-3 Stack provides speed to cover spread formations

**Against Balanced Offenses:**
- Standard 4-3 or 3-4 alignments
- Adjust front based on offensive formation
- Read formation and shift accordingly

**Based on Your Personnel:**
- **4 good defensive linemen:** Run 4-3 even fronts
- **Elite nose tackle + good linebackers:** Run 3-4 odd fronts
- **Pass rushing specialists:** Use under front or wide-9 alignments
- **Smaller/faster defenders:** Use 3-3 or Nickel as base

**Adjusting Fronts in Madden:**

- **Shift Line (L1/LB + Left Stick):** Manually shifts defensive line left/right (creates over/under look)
- **Pinch/Spread Line (L1/LB + Right Stick):** Changes gap spacing (pinch = tighter, spread = wider)
- **Base Align (L1/LB + Down D-pad):** Resets to default front
- **Adjust based on formation:** Watch offensive alignment, shift front to match strength
- **Pre-snap reads:** Identify tight end side, formation strength, run/pass tendency
- **Mix it up:** Don't show same front every play or offense will exploit it

**Front Tips:**

- **Know your base front:** Your team's playbook determines default fronts (4-3 or 3-4 based)
- **Strength to tight end:** Most fronts automatically adjust to tight end side
- **Gap integrity matters:** Every gap must be accounted for vs. the run
- **Create mismatches:** Use fronts to get your best pass rusher on their worst blocker
- **Disguise your front:** Show one front pre-snap, shift at snap for confusion
- **Weather and field position:** Use heavier fronts in bad weather, lighter fronts in open field

**Matching Personnel to Offense:**

- **Offense shows 3+ WR:** Use Nickel or Dime
- **Offense shows 2 TE or FB:** Stay in base 4-3 or 3-4
- **Offense in Shotgun spread:** Use Nickel as minimum, Dime on obvious passing downs
- **Offense under center with power formation:** Use base 4-3/3-4 or Goal Line
- **Count the box:** Aim for 1 more defender in box than offensive blockers for run plays

### 2. Pass Defense

**Coverage Shells:**

Understanding coverage is essential for stopping the pass and defending the right areas.

**Zone Coverages:**

- **Cover 2 Zone:**
  - 2 safeties split deep field in halves (each covers 12+ yards deep)
  - 5 defenders cover underneath zones (corners, linebackers)
  - Corners play flat zones outside, LBs cover hook/curl zones
  - **Strengths:** Stops short passes, good vs. run, forces underneath throws
  - **Weaknesses:** Seam routes between safeties, deep posts, corner routes
  - **When to use:** 1st and 10, short yardage, vs. run-heavy teams

- **Cover 3 Zone:**
  - 3 deep defenders (2 corners, 1 safety) each cover 1/3 of field
  - 4 defenders cover underneath zones
  - Single-high safety in center
  - **Strengths:** Protects sidelines, good vs. vertical routes, balanced
  - **Weaknesses:** Flat routes, corner routes, inside crossing routes
  - **When to use:** Balanced down and distance, default coverage

- **Cover 4 Zone (Quarters):**
  - 4 deep defenders (2 safeties, 2 corners) each cover 1/4 of field
  - 3 underneath defenders
  - Two-high safety look
  - **Strengths:** Prevents deep passes, strong vs. verticals
  - **Weaknesses:** Underneath routes, crossing patterns, screens
  - **When to use:** 3rd and long, prevent situations, vs. deep threats

- **Cover 6:**
  - Combination coverage - Cover 2 on one side, Cover 4 on other
  - Adapts to offensive formation strength
  - **Strengths:** Versatile, disguises coverage
  - **Weaknesses:** Complex assignments, can be confused by motion
  - **When to use:** Vs. unbalanced formations, to disguise coverage

**Man Coverages:**

- **Cover 0 (Man Blitz):**
  - No deep safeties, all defenders in man coverage
  - Usually accompanied by blitz (6+ rushers)
  - **Strengths:** Maximum pressure on QB, aggressive
  - **Weaknesses:** No help over top, vulnerable to quick throws and one-on-ones
  - **When to use:** Critical pass rush situations, backed up opponent, all-or-nothing

- **Cover 1 (Man Free):**
  - 1 deep safety in center field
  - All other defenders in man coverage
  - Safety provides help over the top
  - **Strengths:** Tight coverage, good vs. route concepts, safety help deep
  - **Weaknesses:** Requires good man corners, weak vs. crossing routes
  - **When to use:** When you have man coverage advantage, vs. slower receivers

- **Cover 2 Man:**
  - 2 deep safeties splitting field
  - Underneath defenders in man coverage
  - **Strengths:** Man coverage with safety help, harder to beat deep
  - **Weaknesses:** Crossing routes, pick plays, requires good man defenders
  - **When to use:** 3rd and medium, when you need man coverage but want safety help

**Reading Offensive Formations:**

Pre-snap indicators of what's coming:
- **Shotgun spread (3+ WR):** Likely pass - use Cover 3, Cover 4, or Man
- **Bunch formations:** Expect pick routes - use Cover 2 Man or press coverage
- **Trips (3 WR to one side):** Overload - call Cover 3 or shade coverage to trips side
- **Empty backfield:** Pass play - consider blitz or Cover 0/1
- **I-Form or power formations:** Run likely - use Cover 2 or Cover 3 with run support

**Blitzing:**

Sending extra pass rushers to pressure the QB and disrupt timing.

**Types of Blitzes:**

- **Edge Blitz/Edge Rush:**
  - Outside linebackers or cornerbacks rush from the edge
  - Forces QB to step up in pocket
  - Good vs. slow quarterbacks and play action
  - Vulnerable to quick outside throws and screens

- **A-Gap Blitz (Mike/Will Blitz):**
  - Linebackers blitz through gaps between center and guards
  - Creates immediate interior pressure
  - Difficult for offense to block
  - Risk: Opens up middle of field if QB gets throw off

- **Safety Blitz:**
  - Safety rushes from depth, usually has free run at QB
  - Element of surprise, hard for offense to pick up
  - Leaves secondary vulnerable if blitz doesn't get home
  - Best on obvious passing downs

- **Corner Blitz:**
  - Cornerback abandons coverage to rush
  - Confuses offensive line protections
  - High risk/high reward - leaves receiver uncovered
  - Use sparingly to catch offense off guard

- **Zone Blitz:**
  - Defensive lineman drops into coverage while LB/DB rushes
  - Confuses offensive line and QB reads
  - Good coverage with pressure
  - Requires disciplined execution

- **Overload Blitz:**
  - Send more rushers to one side than offense can block
  - Forces QB to throw hot route or take sack
  - Effective vs. max protect
  - Weak side is vulnerable

**When to Blitz:**

- **3rd and long:** Force quick throw or sack
- **Obvious passing downs:** 2nd and long, shotgun formations
- **Against immobile QBs:** Slow QBs can't escape pressure
- **When opponent is backed up:** Limited space for QB to maneuver
- **To change momentum:** After giving up big plays, blitz can disrupt rhythm
- **Red zone:** Less field to cover, easier to get to QB

**When NOT to Blitz:**

- **3rd and short:** Run play likely, blitz leaves gaps
- **Against mobile QBs:** They'll scramble for first down
- **Against quick passing offenses:** Hot routes and slants beat blitzes
- **When trailing late:** Can't afford to give up big plays

**Blitz Tips:**

- Don't blitz every play - offense will adjust with hot routes
- Mix blitz timing to keep QB guessing
- User control a blitzer for best results
- Blitz from different angles and positions
- Have at least one spy vs. mobile QBs when blitzing

**User Control (Usering):**

Manually controlling a defender is the most impactful defensive skill in Madden.

**Who to User:**

- **Middle Linebacker (MLB):** Most versatile, covers middle of field, good for beginners
- **Strong Safety (SS):** Hybrid defender, can cover TEs and help vs. run
- **Free Safety (FS):** Covers deep middle, prevents big plays, advanced positioning required
- **Blitzer:** User-controlled blitzes are more effective than AI
- **Avoid usering corners:** Let AI handle man coverage unless you're very skilled

**User Control Basics (PlayStation):**

- **Switch players:** Press Triangle to cycle through defenders pre-snap, or tap Triangle post-snap toward nearest defender
- **Strafe (L2/LT):** Move sideways while facing QB, maintains coverage position
- **Lurk (Triangle while in zone):** Jump to intercept pass in your area
- **Dive (Square):** Dive for interception or tackle
- **Swat (Circle):** Knock ball down safely instead of going for INT

**User Techniques:**

**Zone Coverage:**
1. **Pre-snap:** Identify your zone responsibility (hook, curl, deep middle, etc.)
2. **At snap:** Backpedal or strafe to your zone depth
3. **Read QB:** Watch QB's eyes and body language
4. **Break on throw:** When ball is released, break toward it
5. **Make play:** Lurk (Triangle) for INT or swat (Circle) if unsure

**Man Coverage:**
1. **Mirror your man:** Stay between receiver and QB
2. **Use strafe (L2/LT):** Maintain position without turning your back
3. **Watch receiver's hips:** They indicate cuts and direction changes
4. **Play the catch point:** Don't chase the receiver, get to where ball is going
5. **Contest catch:** Time your jump or swat when ball arrives

**Pass Rush:**
1. **Choose your gap:** Pick gap between blockers to attack
2. **Use moves:** Right stick for swim, spin, bull rush moves
3. **Contain outside:** Stay outside the tackle vs. mobile QBs
4. **Don't overrun:** Maintain gap discipline
5. **Time your hit:** Square for conservative sack, X for strip attempt

**User Tips:**

- **Always strafe in coverage** - Never turn your back to the QB
- **Play the ball, not the receiver** - Look for the throw, then react
- **Be patient** - Don't jump too early on lurks or you'll get burned
- **Cover grass, not receivers** - In zone, defend your area
- **Bait the QB** - Act like you're covering one area, then break to another
- **Practice makes perfect** - User control has highest learning curve but biggest impact

**Pre-Snap Adjustments:**

Adjusting your defense before the snap gives you an edge against the offense.

**Defensive Line Adjustments (PlayStation):**

- **Shift Line Left/Right (L1/LB + Left Stick left/right):** Moves entire D-line to one side
  - Use to overload one side or match offensive formation strength
  - Good vs. unbalanced offensive lines

- **Pinch Line (L1/LB + Right Stick down):** Brings defensive ends inside
  - Better interior pass rush
  - Weaker edge contain, vulnerable to outside runs

- **Spread Line (L1/LB + Right Stick up):** Spreads defensive ends wider
  - Better edge contain vs. mobile QBs
  - Weaker interior, vulnerable to inside runs

- **Crash Line (L1/LB + Left Stick up/down):** Sets run defense gap responsibility
  - Crash down: Inside gaps, stops inside runs
  - Crash out: Outside gaps, stops outside runs

**Coverage Adjustments:**

Pre-snap coverage assignments allow you to dictate how your defensive backs position themselves and what areas they prioritize. Mastering these adjustments is critical for taking away your opponent's favorite routes.

**Global vs. Individual Assignments:**

- **Global adjustments (L1/LB + button):** Affect all defensive backs at once
  - Faster to execute
  - Good for general defensive strategy
  - Examples: Press all, Off coverage all, Shade all inside

- **Individual adjustments (Triangle + select defender + direction):**
  - Target specific receivers or formation sides
  - More precise control
  - Takes more time pre-snap
  - Examples: Press slot corner, shade outside corner over top, play safety underneath

**Press Coverage (L1/LB + X for all DBs, or Triangle + select DB + X for individual):**

Defensive backs line up at the line of scrimmage and jam receivers at the snap.

- **Alignment:** DBs line up within 1 yard of line of scrimmage, directly across from receiver
- **Action at snap:** DB uses hands to jam/redirect receiver, disrupting route timing
- **Depth after jam:** DBs turn and run with receiver after initial contact

**Strengths:**
- Disrupts timing routes (slants, quick outs, hitches)
- Slows receivers off the line, gives pass rush more time
- Confuses route concepts that rely on precise timing
- Effective vs. slower receivers (speed rating under 90)
- Forces QB to hold ball longer
- Good in red zone where field is compressed

**Weaknesses:**
- Vulnerable to double moves and fakes (receivers beat press then run free)
- Struggles vs. elite speed receivers who blow past jam
- Weak vs. quick slants if DB misses jam
- Can be beaten by inside/outside releases
- Requires good press coverage ratings (80+)
- Risk of defensive holding penalty

**When to use:**
- 3rd and long (7+ yards) when timing routes are expected
- Vs. bunch formations to disrupt pick plays
- Against slow/possession receivers
- When you have man coverage advantage
- Red zone situations
- Obvious passing downs when you need to disrupt timing

**When NOT to use:**
- Against elite speed receivers (95+ speed)
- Vs. quick passing offenses (they'll slant right past you)
- When your corners have low press ratings (under 75)
- Against physical receivers who will beat the jam
- On long yardage when deep ball is a threat and you can't recover

**Press Coverage Tips:**
- Mix press with off coverage to keep offense guessing
- User a safety to help over top when pressing
- Press the slot receiver to stop crossing routes
- Watch for quick slants - if beaten, don't chase, play next zone
- Combine with blitz for maximum disruption

**Off Coverage/Cushion (L1/LB + Circle for all DBs, or Triangle + select DB + Circle):**

Defensive backs play 5-10 yards off the line of scrimmage, giving receivers space.

- **Alignment:** DBs align 5-10 yards deep, outside or inside shade of receiver
- **Action at snap:** DBs backpedal or shuffle, maintain cushion
- **Technique:** Play "soft" coverage, protecting deep while allowing underneath

**Strengths:**
- Prevents deep balls (safety net against vertical routes)
- Good vs. elite speed receivers (you stay on top of them)
- Allows DBs to read route and react
- Safer against double moves
- Reduces risk of getting beat deep
- Good in prevent situations

**Weaknesses:**
- Allows easy completions underneath (hitches, curls, slants)
- Gives offense free yards on short routes
- Offense can dink and dunk down the field
- Quick passing game exploits cushion
- Reduces pass rush time (ball comes out fast)

**When to use:**
- Prevent defense (protecting lead late in game)
- Vs. very fast receivers who can beat press
- 3rd and very long (15+ yards) - give up short, stop first down
- Two-minute drill defense when preventing deep ball
- Against deep threat receivers
- When protecting a lead and time is more valuable than yards

**When NOT to use:**
- Short yardage situations (3rd and 3 or less)
- When you need a stop
- Vs. precision passing offenses (they'll pick you apart underneath)
- Red zone (too much space given up)

**Off Coverage Tips:**
- Even with cushion, break on the throw
- User a linebacker to cover the underneath zones left open
- Combine with Cover 4 or quarters coverage
- Good against streak-heavy offenses
- Mix in occasional press to keep them honest

**Over the Top Coverage (Triangle + select DB + Right Stick up):**

Defender prioritizes deep coverage, playing over the receiver to prevent vertical routes.

- **Alignment:** DB aligns with outside or inside leverage, depth depends on base coverage
- **Action at snap:** DB immediately gets depth, stays on receiver's upfield shoulder
- **Priority:** Prevent anything deep, force throw underneath or away

**Strengths:**
- Eliminates deep threat completely
- Forces QB to look elsewhere
- Excellent vs. go routes, posts, corners, fades
- Safety net for defending elite receivers
- Works in both man and zone coverage
- Protects against jump balls and aggressive catches

**Weaknesses:**
- Allows easy completions on short/intermediate routes (outs, comebacks, hitches)
- Gives up underneath yards
- Receiver can sit down in zone underneath
- Requires discipline (don't bite on fakes)
- Can be exploited by double moves if DB comes down

**When to use:**
- Against top-tier receivers (90+ overall, elite speed/catching)
- Obvious deep shot situations (3rd and very long, end of half/game)
- When opponent has been attacking deep repeatedly
- Against receivers running verticals and streaks
- Prevent defense
- When doubling a star receiver
- Red zone fades and back-shoulder throws

**When NOT to use:**
- Short yardage (3rd and short, goal line from 1-3 yards)
- When opponent is running exclusively short routes
- Against tight ends on short/intermediate routes
- When you need to stop everything underneath

**Over the Top Tips:**
- Combine with underneath zone defender for complete coverage
- User a safety to help over top on star receiver
- Great for doubling the #1 receiver (corner over top + safety help)
- Shade over top globally on 2nd and long to prevent big plays
- Works best with Cover 2 or Cover 4 shells (safeties deep)

**Underneath Coverage (Triangle + select DB + Right Stick down):**

Defender prioritizes short/intermediate coverage, playing underneath receiver to stop quick routes.

- **Alignment:** DB plays tighter to line, focuses on 0-15 yard depth
- **Action at snap:** DB stays short, jumps underneath routes, attacks at catch point
- **Priority:** Stop short completions, allow deep (trust help over top)

**Strengths:**
- Stops quick passing game (slants, hitches, outs, curls)
- Aggressive on short throws, can create turnovers
- Forces QB to go deep (where help is waiting)
- Excellent for jumping routes and baiting QB
- Good in red zone and short yardage
- Stops rhythm passing offense

**Weaknesses:**
- Vulnerable to deep routes if no help over top
- Can be beaten by double moves (hitch and go, stop and go)
- Requires safety help or you'll give up big plays
- Risky if corner is left on island
- Can get burnt by play action over the top

**When to use:**
- Against quick passing offenses (slant, hitch, out routes)
- When you have safety help deep (Cover 2, Cover 3)
- Red zone defense (short field, less deep threat)
- 3rd and short/medium (stop the sticks)
- Against possession receivers (slow but good hands)
- When you want to bait QB into underneath throw then jump it
- To stop specific route combinations (mesh, crosses, shallow)

**When NOT to use:**
- Without safety help over top (you'll give up TDs)
- Against deep threats on obvious passing downs
- When in man coverage without help
- 3rd and very long when preventing first down is priority

**Underneath Coverage Tips:**
- Always have safety help over the top
- User the underneath defender for better reads
- Great for lurking and baiting interceptions
- Combine with Cover 2 or Cover 3
- Jump routes only when certain (or you'll get burned deep)
- Watch for play action - don't bite up if safety isn't helping

**Inside Shade (Triangle + select DB + Right Stick left/right toward middle):**

Defender favors inside leverage, protecting middle of field and forcing throws outside.

- **Alignment:** DB aligns with inside leverage on receiver (between receiver and QB)
- **Action at snap:** DB maintains inside position, funnels receiver to sideline
- **Priority:** Protect crossing routes, slants, posts - force outs and fades

**Strengths:**
- Stops inside breaking routes (slants, digs, posts, crosses)
- Protects middle of field (most dangerous area)
- Forces throws to sideline (safer, boundary helps)
- Prevents crossing routes from getting open
- Good against trips formations (shade all inside to stop mesh/crosses)
- Eliminates the most efficient routes

**Weaknesses:**
- Vulnerable to outside routes (outs, comebacks, corner routes, fades)
- Gives QB easy sideline throws
- Can be exploited by out-and-up routes
- Corner routes beat inside shade
- If receiver releases outside, DB is trailing

**When to use:**
- Against offenses that attack the middle (slants, crosses, posts)
- Vs. trips formations (stop bunch/mesh concepts)
- When protecting the middle of the field is priority
- In red zone to force fades to sideline
- Against spread offenses
- When opponent loves slot receiver crossing routes
- To funnel receivers to help defense

**When NOT to use:**
- Against fade-heavy offenses
- When opponent attacks sidelines exclusively
- Vs. bunch formations on sideline (they want out routes anyway)
- When corners can't recover to outside routes

**Inside Shade Tips:**
- Shade inside globally vs. trips or bunch formations
- Combine with Cover 2 or Cover 4 (safeties help outside)
- Forces throws to boundary where sideline helps
- Excellent vs. crossing route concepts
- User a linebacker to clean up middle crossing routes that get through
- Good with press coverage to completely shut down slants

**Outside Shade (Triangle + select DB + Right Stick toward sideline):**

Defender favors outside leverage, protecting sideline and forcing throws inside.

- **Alignment:** DB aligns outside the receiver (between receiver and sideline)
- **Action at snap:** DB maintains outside position, funnels receiver inside
- **Priority:** Protect outside routes (outs, corners, comebacks) - force slants inside to help

**Strengths:**
- Stops outside breaking routes (outs, corners, comebacks, fades)
- Takes away sideline throws (offense can't stop clock easily)
- Forces throws into middle where help defense is
- Good in two-minute defense (prevents clock stoppage)
- Protects boundary
- Forces receivers into traffic

**Weaknesses:**
- Vulnerable to inside routes (slants, posts, digs, crosses)
- Opens up middle of field (dangerous area)
- Can be beaten by slant-and-go routes
- If receiver releases inside, DB is trailing
- Linebackers and safeties must help inside

**When to use:**
- Two-minute defense (prevent sideline catches that stop clock)
- When opponent attacks sidelines exclusively
- Against corner route and out route specialists
- To protect against fade routes in red zone
- When you have strong safety help inside
- Late in half/game when sideline = clock stoppage
- Against offenses with elite outside route runners

**When NOT to use:**
- Against inside route-heavy offenses (you'll get picked apart)
- Without safety help inside
- When middle of field is already vulnerable
- Vs. bunch/trips formations (they want inside anyway)

**Outside Shade Tips:**
- Use in two-minute defense to keep clock running
- Combine with Cover 3 (single-high safety helps inside)
- Forces receivers into linebackers and safeties
- Good vs. specific receivers who run great out routes
- Can create INTs by funneling throws inside to lurking safety/LB
- Risky against crossing concepts - need help inside

**Cloud/Hard Flats (Triangle + select flat defender + assignment):**

Adjusts flat zone defenders (usually corners) to play deeper or more aggressive.

- **Cloud Flat (soft):**
  - Corner plays deep 1/4 zone, gives cushion to flat
  - Protects corner routes and deep outs
  - Allows quick outs and flats underneath
  - Use vs. vertical/corner route threats

- **Hard Flat (aggressive):**
  - Corner plays aggressive flat zone (0-5 yards)
  - Jumps quick outs, screens, and flats
  - Vulnerable to corner routes and deep outs
  - Use vs. quick passing, screens, and short game

**General Adjustment Commands:**

- **Show Blitz (L1/LB + Up on D-pad):**
  - Brings safeties and LBs to line pre-snap
  - Disguises coverage, makes offense think blitz is coming
  - Can back out into coverage after showing blitz
  - Helps disguise if you're actually blitzing or dropping into zone
  - Can cause offense to change protections or audible

- **Base Align (L1/LB + Down on D-pad):**
  - Resets all adjustments to default
  - Use if you made wrong adjustment or offense audibles
  - Returns everyone to original positions
  - Quick way to undo mistakes pre-snap

**Linebacker Adjustments:**

- **Spy (Triangle + select LB/Safety + flick Right Stick down):**
  - Defender shadows QB, contains scrambles
  - Critical vs. mobile quarterbacks
  - Sacrifices that defender from coverage

- **QB Contain (L1/LB + flick Right Stick down):**
  - Edge rushers maintain outside contain instead of rushing inside
  - Keeps mobile QB in pocket
  - Prevents rollouts and scrambles to outside

**Adjustment Strategy:**

- **Vs. Trips formation:** Shade coverage to trips side, bring safety over
- **Vs. bunch/stack:** Press coverage to disrupt pick routes
- **Vs. mobile QB:** Set QB spy or contain
- **Vs. quick passing:** Press coverage, show blitz
- **Vs. deep threats:** Off coverage, shade over top
- **Vs. run-heavy:** Crash line to expected run direction, base align
- **After motion:** Adjust to new formation, check for mismatches

### 3. Run Defense

**Understanding Gap Assignments (Run Fits):**

Each defender is responsible for a specific gap to prevent run lanes.

**Gap Naming:**
- From left to right: C gap - B gap - A gap - A gap - B gap - C gap
- **A gaps:** Between center and guards (2 A gaps)
- **B gaps:** Between guards and tackles (2 B gaps)
- **C gaps:** Between tackles and tight ends, or outside the tackle (2 C gaps)
- **D gaps:** Outside the tight end (2 D gaps)

**Gap Responsibilities by Position:**

- **Defensive Tackles (DT):** Typically responsible for A and B gaps
  - Must hold ground, don't get pushed back
  - Occupy blockers to free up linebackers

- **Defensive Ends (DE):** Typically responsible for C gaps and edge contain
  - Set the edge, force runs back inside
  - Don't let RB get outside you

- **Linebackers (LB):** Fill gaps based on defensive call
  - Read the offensive line for run direction
  - Flow to the ball while maintaining gap integrity
  - MLB typically has A or B gap
  - OLBs have B, C, or D gaps

- **Safeties/CBs:** Outside contain and pursuit
  - Force carrier back inside to help
  - Don't overrun the play

**Reading and Reacting to Runs:**

1. **Read your keys:** Watch offensive linemen in your gap
   - **Lineman blocks down (away from you):** Flow to that side, fill your gap
   - **Lineman blocks you:** Engage, shed block, make tackle
   - **Lineman pulls:** Counter or trap play coming, be ready

2. **Gap discipline:** Stay in your assigned gap
   - Don't chase the ball if it means leaving your gap
   - One defender out of position creates a lane
   - Trust your teammates to fill their gaps

3. **Pursue the ball:** Once you've confirmed ball is away from your gap
   - Take proper pursuit angle to ball carrier
   - Don't take yourself out of play with bad angle

4. **Make the tackle:** Break down and wrap up

**Shedding Blocks:**

Getting past offensive linemen to make tackles.

**Techniques:**
- **Swim Move (Right Stick up):** Swipe arm over blocker's shoulder
  - Quick move, good vs. pass protection
  - Timing is critical

- **Spin Move (Right Stick rotate):** Spin away from blocker
  - Effective but can take you out of gap
  - Use in pursuit, not primary gap responsibility

- **Bull Rush (Right Stick down):** Drive blocker backward with power
  - Best for strong defensive linemen
  - Maintains gap integrity

- **Rip Move (Right Stick left/right):** Rip arm through blocker
  - Good vs. reach blocks
  - Quick move to stay in gap

- **Shed Block (X button):** Push blocker away
  - Basic move to disengage
  - Works vs. most blocks but not flashy

**Run Defense Tips:**

- **Stay low:** Lower pad level wins
- **Use hands:** Keep blockers off your body
- **Don't chase:** Maintain gap discipline even if ball goes away
- **Flow to ball:** Once you've cleared your gap, pursue
- **Tackle in space:** Break down, don't dive from too far
- **User a linebacker:** Best position to read and react to runs
- **Stack the box:** Get 8+ defenders against run-heavy teams
- **Don't over-pursue:** Counter and cutback runs exploit this

**Tackling:**

Making the tackle is the ultimate goal of defense. Different situations call for different tackling techniques.

**Tackling Types (PlayStation Controls):**

- **Conservative Tackle (X button):**
  - Wrap up tackle, most reliable
  - Almost never causes fumbles
  - Lowest risk of broken tackle
  - **When to use:** Open field, securing the tackle, when ahead late
  - **Advantage:** Consistent, safe
  - **Disadvantage:** Won't force fumbles or big hits

- **Aggressive Tackle/Hit Stick (Square or Right Stick up/down):**
  - Big hit attempt, can force fumbles
  - Right Stick up: High hit stick
  - Right Stick down: Low hit stick
  - Higher risk of broken tackle or penalty
  - **When to use:** Need a turnover, vs. smaller ball carriers, when trailing
  - **Advantage:** Can cause fumbles and injuries
  - **Disadvantage:** Can be broken, can miss entirely, possible penalties

- **Dive Tackle (Square when not close):**
  - Desperation dive at ball carrier
  - Extends reach but easy to break
  - **When to use:** Last resort, pursuit angles, preventing touchdowns
  - **Advantage:** Extended range
  - **Disadvantage:** Easy to juke, leaves you on ground if missed

- **Strip Ball (R1/RB when near ball carrier):**
  - Attempt to punch ball out without tackling
  - Can force fumbles but lets carrier keep running if unsuccessful
  - **When to use:** Multiple defenders nearby, when trailing, vs. poor ball security
  - **Advantage:** Can force fumbles
  - **Disadvantage:** Doesn't guarantee tackle

**Tackling Technique:**

1. **Break down:** Slow down as you approach ball carrier
   - Don't run full speed into tackle
   - Get under control for better positioning

2. **Proper angle:** Take angle that cuts off ball carrier
   - Don't chase from directly behind
   - Aim for where they're going, not where they are

3. **Square up:** Face ball carrier straight on when possible
   - Better chance to make tackle
   - Harder for them to juke or spin

4. **Time your hit:** Press button as you make contact
   - Too early: Whiff completely
   - Too late: Broken tackle
   - Just right: Solid tackle

5. **Gang tackle:** Multiple defenders near ball carrier
   - First defender: Conservative tackle to secure
   - Second/third defender: Strip attempt or aggressive tackle

**Tackling Situations:**

- **Open field (one-on-one):** Conservative tackle, square up, take good angle
- **Multiple defenders nearby:** First wraps up, second strips ball
- **Goal line stand:** Aggressive tackles, try to jar ball loose
- **Sideline:** Dive tackle or conservative to push out of bounds
- **Broken play/scrambling QB:** Contain first, conservative tackle second
- **Late in game (winning):** Conservative tackles, don't risk broken tackles
- **Late in game (losing):** Aggressive tackles and strips, need turnovers

**Tackling Tips:**

- **Don't spam hit stick** - Use conservative tackles most of the time
- **User tackle for best results** - AI makes mistakes
- **Multiple defenders = strip attempts** - Safe to gamble when help is nearby
- **Watch stamina** - Tired defenders miss more tackles
- **Size matters** - Big defenders hit stick small ball carriers effectively
- **Ball security rating** - Strip against low ball security players

### 4. Creating Turnovers

Turnovers change games. Creating fumbles and interceptions requires good timing and decision-making.

**Forcing Fumbles:**

**Hit Stick (Square or Right Stick up/down):**
- Big hit that can jar ball loose
- Right Stick up: High hit stick (targets upper body/ball)
- Right Stick down: Low hit stick (targets legs)
- **Best situations:**
  - Small ball carriers (WR, RB under 200 lbs)
  - Low ball security ratings
  - Ball carrier in vulnerable position (reaching, jumping, cutting)
  - When trailing and need turnovers
- **Risk:** Can miss entirely or get broken tackle

**Strip Ball (R1/RB):**
- Punch at the ball without tackling
- Works best with multiple defenders nearby
- Lower success rate but keeps play alive if unsuccessful
- **Best situations:**
  - Gang tackle situations (2+ defenders)
  - Ball carrier slowed down or engaged with other defender
  - Trailing late in game, need turnovers desperately
- **Tips:**
  - Time it as ball carrier is turning or cutting
  - Works better on tired ball carriers
  - Check ball carrier's carry rating (lower = more fumbles)

**Strip on Sack (R1/RB during sack):**
- Attempt to strip ball while sacking QB
- Press R1/RB as you're tackling the QB
- Higher success rate than regular strip
- **Best situations:**
  - Obvious passing downs
  - QB holding ball too long
  - Multiple pass rushers arriving
- **Risk:** Sometimes QB gets throw off anyway

**Interception Mechanics:**

**Going for the Pick vs. Swatting:**

- **Swat (Circle button):**
  - Knock ball down safely
  - Guarantees incompletion
  - No risk of dropped INT or penalty
  - **When to use:** Winning late, poor position, ball low/behind, double covered receiver

- **Interception (Triangle button):**
  - Attempt to catch the ball
  - Can be dropped, leading to completion
  - Can return for yards or TD
  - **When to use:** Good position, ball in front, user-controlled defender, when trailing

- **Aggressive Catch (Hold Triangle + L2/LT):**
  - Jump aggressively for ball
  - Highest INT chance but also highest drop chance
  - Can cause interference penalty
  - **When to use:** Perfect position, underthrown ball, desperate situations

**User Interception Technique:**

1. **Read the QB:** Watch his eyes and throwing motion
2. **Break on the throw:** Start moving toward target as ball is released
3. **Take proper angle:** Get to where ball will be, not where it is
4. **Time the jump:** Press Triangle just before ball arrives
5. **Secure catch:** Hold Triangle until catch animation completes

**Interception Tips:**

- **Play zone, not man:** User defenders in zone coverage see more opportunities
- **Bait the QB:** Fake covering one receiver, then jump the route to another
- **User a linebacker or safety:** Best positions for reading throws
- **High awareness DBs:** More likely to break on balls and make plays
- **Swat in traffic:** Pick when you have good position
- **Watch for tips:** Deflected balls are easier to intercept
- **Don't jump too early:** Ball will sail over you
- **Strafe while waiting:** Stay facing QB, use L2/LT

**Creating Turnover Situations:**

- **Pressure the QB:** Hurried throws lead to bad decisions
- **Good coverage:** Force QB to hold ball longer
- **Disguise coverage:** Make QB think someone is open
- **Strip after catch:** Hit receivers immediately after catch
- **Stack the box on runs:** More defenders = more fumble chances
- **Target weak ball carriers:** Attack players with low carry/catch ratings
- **Weather matters:** Rain/snow increases fumbles

**Ball Hawk Trait:**

Some defenders have Ball Hawk ability:
- Automatically react to balls in the air
- Better animations for interceptions
- More likely to make plays on the ball
- User these defenders for maximum effectiveness

### 5. Situational Defense

Adjusting your defensive strategy based on down, distance, and game situation is critical for success.

**By Down and Distance:**

**1st and 10:**
- Most balanced situation
- Use base defense (Nickel) with Cover 2 or Cover 3
- Stop the run first, then pass

- Bring calculated pressure
- Force three-and-outs
- User control for big plays

**Losing by multiple scores:**
- Ultra aggressive
- Constant pressure
- Go for turnovers
- Take risks
- All-or-nothing mentality

### 6. Coaching Adjustments

Coaching adjustments allow you to customize defensive assignments, matchups, and AI behavior. These settings persist throughout the game and give you strategic control beyond play calling.

**How to Access Coaching Adjustments:**

Access coaching adjustments through the pause menu:
- **PlayStation:** Press Options button → Select "Coaching Adjustments"
- Adjustments can be made before the game, at halftime, or during timeouts
- Most adjustments persist throughout the game until changed

**Cornerback Matchups:**

Controls how your cornerbacks are assigned to cover receivers. This is one of the most important defensive adjustments.

**Cornerback Matchup Options (Madden 26):**

- **Balanced (Recommended):** Default setting that balances all factors
  - Most stable option, avoids assignment glitches
  - Good for most situations
  - **Use this setting** to prevent weird defensive behavior

- **By Depth Chart:** CBs match receivers based on depth chart order
  - CB1 covers WR1, CB2 covers WR2, etc.
  - Simple and predictable
  - Good when your depth chart is properly organized

- **By Route Running:** Assigns CBs based on receiver's route running rating
  - Your best man coverage CB covers their best route runner
  - Good against precision route runners
  - Can create mismatches if receivers have similar ratings

- **By Height:** Assigns CBs based on receiver height
  - Tall CBs cover tall receivers
  - Prevents jump ball advantages
  - Great in red zone against big-bodied receivers
  - Use when opponent has 6'3"+ receivers

- **By Speed:** Assigns CBs based on receiver speed rating
  - Fastest CB covers fastest receiver
  - Prevents getting burned deep
  - Use against speed-based offenses (95+ speed receivers)

- **By Overall:** Assigns CBs based on receiver overall rating
  - Best CB covers best overall receiver
  - Balanced approach
  - Good when you want simplest matchup logic

**CB Matchup Strategy:**

**Keep It On Balanced:**
- Other matchup settings can cause assignment glitches in Madden 26
- Balanced avoids weird coverage behavior and keeps matchups stable
- Only change if you have a very specific reason

**When To Use Specific Matchups:**
- **By Height:** Red zone defense against tall receivers, goal line situations
- **By Speed:** Against spread offenses with multiple speed threats
- **By Overall:** When opponent has one elite receiver and weak supporting cast
- **Return to Balanced** after the specific situation passes

**Auto Flip Defensive Play Call:**

Automatically flips your defensive play call to match the offensive formation strength (where tight end/running back align).

**Settings:**

- **OFF (Recommended for advanced players):**
  - You control defensive alignment manually
  - Allows you to disguise coverage and bait offense
  - Better for setting up specific blitzes and stunts
  - Requires understanding of defensive fronts and formation strength

- **ON (Good for beginners):**
  - Defense automatically adjusts to offensive formation
  - Ensures proper alignment every play
  - Prevents getting caught in bad alignments
  - Less control but more consistent

**When to use:**
- **Turn OFF** if you want full control over defensive setup
- **Turn ON** if you're learning defense and want automatic alignment
- **Turn OFF** when you want to bait offense (show weak side, but defend it)

**Defensive Ball Hawk:**

Helps AI defenders automatically position themselves for interceptions and pass breakups.

**Settings:**

- **ON (Recommended):**
  - AI defenders react better to balls in the air
  - Better positioning for interceptions
  - More aggressive on pass breakups
  - Helps non-user defenders make plays

- **OFF:**
  - AI defenders less aggressive on balls
  - More conservative positioning
  - Can reduce interceptions but also reduces drops

**Recommendation:** Keep this **ON** in Madden 26 - it significantly improves AI defender reactions to passes.

**Custom Zone Drops:**

One of the most important defensive adjustments in competitive Madden. Controls the depth of your zone defenders.

**Zone Types You Can Adjust:**

**Flat Zones (Outside short zones):**
- **Default depth:** 0-5 yards
- **Shallow:** 0-3 yards (more aggressive on quick outs and screens)
- **Medium:** 3-5 yards (balanced)
- **Deep:** 5-8 yards (gives more cushion, protects against out routes)
- **When to adjust:**
  - Shallow vs. screen-heavy offenses
  - Deep vs. aggressive out route offenses

**Curl Flat Zones (Outside intermediate zones):**
- **Default depth:** 5-12 yards
- **Shallow:** 5-8 yards (jumps curls and comebacks)
- **Medium:** 8-12 yards (balanced)
- **Deep:** 12-15 yards (protects deep outs and corners)
- **When to adjust:**
  - Shallow vs. curl/comeback heavy offenses
  - Deep vs. deep out and corner routes

**Hook Zones (Middle zones):**
- **Default depth:** 10-15 yards
- **Shallow:** 8-12 yards (stops crossing routes and drags)
- **Medium:** 10-15 yards (balanced)
- **Deep:** 15-20 yards (protects seams and posts)
- **When to adjust:**
  - Shallow vs. crossing route concepts (mesh, drags)
  - Deep vs. seam and post routes

**Custom Zone Drop Strategy:**

**General recommendations:**
- Start with **Medium (default)** for all zones
- **Shallow all zones** vs. short passing offenses (West Coast, quick game)
- **Deep all zones** vs. vertical passing offenses (deep shots, seams)
- **Mix depths** based on opponent's tendencies

**By down and distance:**
- **3rd and short (1-5 yards):** Shallow flat and curl flats, medium hooks
- **3rd and medium (6-10 yards):** Medium all zones
- **3rd and long (11+ yards):** Deep curl flats and hooks, medium flats

**Heat Seeker Assist:**

Controls how much the game helps you make tackles when using user control.

**Settings:**

- **0-100%:** Less assistance, more manual control
- **100-200%:** More assistance, acts as "magnet" pulling defender to ball carrier
- **200% (Recommended for Madden 26):** Maximum assistance
  - Helps make more tackles
  - Easier to control user defender
  - Recommended setting based on competitive community

**Note:** This affects user-controlled defenders only, not AI.

**Pass Commit / Run Commit:**

Tells your defense to prioritize pass or run defense, adjusting AI behavior.

**Pass Commit:**
- **What it does:** Defenders prioritize pass coverage
  - DBs play deeper, react to passes faster
  - Linebackers drop into zones quicker
  - Pass rush more aggressive
  - Run gaps may be left open
- **When to use:**
  - 3rd and long (8+ yards)
  - Two-minute drill defense
  - Obvious passing situations
  - When protecting lead late in game
- **Risk:** Vulnerable to runs, especially draws

**Run Commit:**
- **What it does:** Defenders prioritize run support
  - Linebackers attack gaps immediately
  - Safeties come up for run support
  - Pass coverage suffers
- **When to use:**
  - 3rd and short (1-3 yards)
  - Goal line situations
  - When opponent is running clock
  - Obvious run situations
- **Risk:** Vulnerable to play action and deep passes

**Balanced (Default):**
- Defenders read and react
- Best for most situations

**How to set (PlayStation):**
- Pre-snap: Press **R2/RT** to access quick adjustments
- Select Pass Commit, Run Commit, or Balanced
- Lasts for one play only unless set in Coaching Adjustments menu

**Play Ball vs. Strip Ball:**

Adjusts AI defender behavior on tackles and pass attempts.

**Play Ball (Conservative):**
- **What it does:** Defenders prioritize safe plays
  - More swat animations instead of interception attempts
  - Wrap-up tackles instead of hit sticks
  - Reduces turnovers but prevents big plays
- **When to use:**
  - When winning and protecting lead
  - Against aggressive catch receivers
  - Prevent defense situations
  - When your DBs have low catch ratings

**Strip Ball (Aggressive):**
- **What it does:** Defenders prioritize creating turnovers
  - More interception attempts
  - Aggressive strip attempts on tackles
  - Increases turnovers but also risk
- **When to use:**
  - When trailing and need turnovers
  - Against receivers with low carry/catch ratings
  - Red zone defense (force fumbles)
  - Desperate situations

**Balanced (Default):**
- Mix of both behaviors

**Defensive Speed Packages:**

Automatically substitutes faster players (safeties/CBs) for slower players (linebackers) in sub packages.

**ON:**
- Better speed to cover spread formations
- Good against passing offenses
- Weaker run defense

**OFF:**
- Keeps your base personnel
- Better run defense
- Slower in coverage

**When to use ON:**
- Against 3+ WR formations
- Against mobile quarterbacks
- Two-minute drill defense

**Coaching Adjustment Quick Guide:**

**Essential Settings (Madden 26):**
1. **Cornerback Matchups:** Keep on **Balanced** (avoid glitches)
2. **Auto Flip Defense:** **OFF** for control, **ON** for beginners
3. **Defensive Ball Hawk:** **ON** (helps AI make plays)
4. **Custom Zone Drops:** Start **Medium**, adjust based on opponent
5. **Heat Seeker Assist:** **200%** (maximum tackle help)

**Situational Adjustments:**
- **3rd and long:** Pass Commit ON
- **3rd and short:** Run Commit ON
- **Winning late:** Play Ball ON (conservative)
- **Losing late:** Strip Ball ON (need turnovers)
- **Red zone:** Strip Ball ON (force fumbles)

**Common Mistakes:**

- **Using non-Balanced CB matchups:** Can cause assignment glitches in Madden 26
- **Forgetting zone drops:** Custom zone drops are crucial for competitive play
- **Wrong Heat Seeker setting:** 200% is optimal for making tackles
- **Over-committing:** Don't pass commit on 1st down
- **Not using Ball Hawk:** Keep it ON for better AI reactions

**Advanced Tips:**

- **Combine adjustments:** Pass Commit + Deep zone drops + Play Ball = Prevent defense
- **Adjust at halftime:** Check what's beating you, adjust zones accordingly
- **Zone drops by formation:** Deep zones vs. spread, shallow zones vs. compressed formations
- **Pre-snap vs. coaching menu:** Use R2/RT for quick one-play adjustments, coaching menu for persistent changes
