# Special Teams Guide

Often overlooked, special teams can win or lose close games. This guide covers the third phase of the game - kicking, punting, and returns. Special teams determines field position, provides scoring opportunities, and creates game-changing plays. Mastering special teams gives you an edge in close contests and can be the difference between winning and losing. This guide covers kicking mechanics, return strategies, coverage techniques, and situational special teams decisions.

## Key Concepts

### 1. Kicking Game

**Field Goals & Extra Points:**

**Kicking Meter Mechanics (PlayStation):**

Field goals use a 3-click meter system:

1. **First click (X button):** Starts the power meter
   - Meter begins filling from left to right
   - Let it fill to desired power level

2. **Second click (X button):** Sets power
   - Click when meter reaches desired power
   - More power = longer distance but less accuracy
   - Sweet spot: Just before max for long kicks, 75-85% for accuracy

3. **Third click (X button):** Sets accuracy
   - Meter returns from right to left
   - Click when meter is in the green/white zone (center)
   - Green zone = perfect accuracy
   - Miss the zone = kick goes left or right

**Aiming the Kick (Left Stick before first click):**
- Move Left Stick left or right to aim
- Useful for: Adjusting for wind, icing conditions, or strategic placement
- Center aim is default and most accurate

**Wind Adjustment:**
- Check wind indicator (arrow on screen)
- **Wind in your face:** Add more power, aim slightly into wind
- **Wind at your back:** Use less power to avoid overshooting
- **Crosswind:** Aim into the wind to compensate
  - Strong crosswind left: Aim slightly right
  - Strong crosswind right: Aim slightly left

**Distance Guidelines:**
- **Under 40 yards:** Easy, use 75-80% power for accuracy
- **40-50 yards:** Moderate, use 85-90% power
- **50-55 yards:** Difficult, use 95-100% power, perfect timing required
- **55+ yards:** Very difficult, need strong-legged kicker and perfect execution

**Extra Points:**
- Same mechanics as field goals but much shorter (33 yards)
- Use 60-70% power for easy make
- Focus on accuracy click, not power
- Very rarely missed unless you botch the meter

**Field Goal Tips:**
- **Practice the timing:** Rhythm is everything - click, click, click
- **Don't overthink:** Muscle memory beats deliberation
- **Ice conditions:** Rain/snow makes accuracy harder
- **Kicker fatigue:** Don't overuse kicker, ratings matter
- **Icing timeout:** If opponent calls timeout to ice you, reset your rhythm

**Kickoffs:**

Kickoffs determine starting field position after scores and at the start of each half.

**Kickoff Types:**

**Standard Kickoff (Normal kick):**
- Deep kick aiming for touchback
- Touchback = ball placed at 25-yard line automatically
- No return, safest option
- **When to use:** Most situations, when protecting lead, when coverage is weak
- **Execution:** Max power (95-100%), aim center

**Squib Kick:**
- Low, bouncing kick that's hard to return cleanly
- Usually fielded by front-line blockers, not returner
- Prevents big returns but gives better field position than touchback
- **When to use:** End of half to prevent return TD, prevent elite returner from touching ball
- **Execution:** 50-60% power, aim center or at gaps between players
- **Result:** Usually recovered around 35-40 yard line

**Sky Kick (High, short kick):**
- High, short kick with lots of hang time
- Allows coverage to get downfield before catch
- Risky - can result in good returns if coverage fails
- **When to use:** Need to force opponent to return, have great coverage team
- **Execution:** 70-80% power, aim left or right to sideline
- **Goal:** Pin returner inside 20-yard line

**Onside Kick:**
- Short kick attempting to recover possession
- Must travel 10 yards before kicking team can recover
- Low success rate (10-20%) but can change games
- **When to use:** Trailing late, need possession desperately
- **Execution:** See Trick Plays section below

**Directional Kickoffs (Left/Right):**
- Kick to sideline instead of middle
- Forces returner to one side, easier to contain
- Aim away from elite returners
- **Execution:** Use Left Stick to aim before kick, normal power

**Kickoff Strategy:**
- **Leading late:** Kick touchbacks, don't risk return TDs
- **Tied game:** Normal kickoffs, play it safe
- **Trailing:** Consider sky kicks to pin them deep, force 3-and-out
- **End of half:** Squib kick to prevent return TD with no time
- **Good coverage unit:** Use sky kicks to pin inside 20

### 2. Punting

Punting is about flipping field position and pinning the opponent deep in their territory.

**Punt Mechanics (PlayStation):**

Punting uses the same 3-click meter as field goals:
1. **X button:** Start meter (power)
2. **X button:** Set power (higher = more distance)
3. **X button:** Set accuracy (hit green zone for straight punt)

**Punt Types:**

**Standard Punt:**
- Maximum distance and hang time
- Aim for 45-55 yards with good hang time
- **Execution:** 90-100% power, center aim
- **Goal:** Pin them inside 20, or touchback (placed at 20)

**Coffin Corner Punt:**
- Angled punt toward sideline near goal line
- High risk/high reward - can pin inside 5 or go out of bounds
- **Execution:** 75-85% power, aim Left Stick fully left or right
- **When to use:** 4th down from opponent's 35-45 yard line
- **Goal:** Out of bounds inside 10-yard line
- **Risk:** Can go into end zone for touchback (placed at 20)

**Pooch Punt:**
- Short, high punt with lots of hang time
- Allows coverage to get downfield before catch
- **Execution:** 60-70% power, aim center or corners
- **When to use:** Inside opponent's 40, want to pin deep
- **Goal:** Down ball inside 10 before touchback

**Sky Punt:**
- Maximum hang time, less distance
- Gives coverage time to get downfield
- **Execution:** 70-80% power, focus on perfect accuracy
- **When to use:** When you have great coverage unit
- **Goal:** Fair catch or tackle returner immediately

**Punt Aiming and Placement:**

- **Left Stick before kick:** Aim punt direction
- **Aim left/right:** For coffin corner or directional punts
- **Aim center:** For standard punts down middle of field

**Punting Strategy:**

**By Field Position:**

- **Own territory (own 1-40):** Standard punt for max distance, don't risk blocked kick
- **Midfield (40-50 yard line):** Standard punt or pooch punt to pin deep
- **Opponent territory (opponent 35-45):** Coffin corner attempt or pooch punt
- **Inside opponent 35:** Probably go for it or attempt field goal, not punt range

**By Game Situation:**

- **Leading:** Punt conservatively, flip field position, don't risk blocks
- **Tied:** Normal punts, play field position
- **Trailing:** Consider going for it more often, need possession
- **4th and short:** Consider going for it vs. punting
- **End of half:** Punt quickly, don't waste time

**Punting Tips:**

- **Hang time matters:** Good hang time (4.5+ seconds) prevents returns
- **Touchbacks are okay:** Punt from midfield, touchback pins them at 20 (not bad)
- **Don't outkick coverage:** Huge punt with no hang time = return TD
- **Watch the wind:** Adjust power and aim for wind
- **Punt protection:** Recognize blitzes, may need to quick punt
- **Fair catches:** Force them with high, accurate punts

**When NOT to Punt:**

- **4th and 1-2 in opponent territory:** Go for it
- **4th and short in plus territory:** Consider going for it
- **Trailing late (under 5 minutes):** Need possessions, go for it more
- **Field goal range:** Attempt FG instead of punt (inside opponent 35)

### 3. Return Game

**Kick Returns:**

Kick returns can flip field position or score touchdowns. Requires patience and vision.

**Return Controls (PlayStation):**
- **Catch kick:** Press Triangle to catch (automatic if you're there)
- **Fair catch:** Hold Triangle before ball arrives (cannot be tackled, but no return)
- **Run:** Use Left Stick to control returner after catch
- **Moves:** Right Stick for juke, spin, stiff arm (same as ball carrier moves)
- **Turbo:** Hold R2 to sprint

**Reading the Return:**

1. **Watch your blocks:** See where blockers are setting up
2. **Identify the lane:** Look for running lane between blockers
3. **Be patient:** Let blocks develop, don't outrun blockers
4. **Hit the hole:** Accelerate through the lane with R2
5. **Make one move:** One cut/juke to beat final defender, then go vertical

**Kick Return Strategy:**

- **Standard returns:** Follow blocks, look for lane up middle or to sideline
- **Middle return:** Safest, shortest path upfield
- **Sideline return:** Longer distance but only defend one side
- **Don't bounce everything outside:** Sometimes the lane is inside

**When to Take a Knee (Touchback):**
- Kick lands in end zone and you catch it
- Press Circle to kneel (ball placed at 25-yard line)
- **When to kneel:** Deep in end zone, poor blocking setup, protecting lead
- **When to return:** Kick lands near goal line, good blocking, need big play

**Punt Returns:**

Punt returns are riskier but can gain more yards due to better field position.

**Fair Catch vs. Return Decision:**

**Fair Catch (Hold Triangle before catch):**
- Cannot be tackled but cannot return
- **When to use:**
  - Surrounded by coverage team
  - Punt has huge hang time, defenders are close
  - Deep in your own territory (inside 10)
  - Protecting lead late
  - Bad field position or poor blocking

**Return the Punt:**
- **When to use:**
  - Good blocking setup
  - Coverage team is spread out
  - Short punt with low hang time
  - Need big play
  - Trailing and need momentum

**Let It Bounce:**
- Don't catch it, let it bounce and roll
- **When to use:**
  - Punt is over your head going toward your goal line (will bounce back)
  - Punt going out of bounds (let it for better field position)
  - Surrounded by defenders with no fair catch called
- **Risk:** Can bounce forward and pin you deeper

**Punt Return Tips:**

- **Call fair catch when in doubt:** Fumbles are devastating
- **Watch hang time:** High hang time = coverage is close = fair catch
- **Field position matters:** Returns from your 5 are risky, from your 20 are safer
- **Don't muff it:** Focus on catching first, running second
- **Elite returner:** If you have great returner, take more chances

**Return Game Tips:**

- **User control the returner:** AI returners make poor decisions
- **Vision is key:** See the whole field, find the lane
- **One cut:** Make one decisive move, not multiple jukes
- **Protect the ball:** Hold R1 to cover ball when hit is coming
- **Don't force it:** Sometimes 20-yard return is better than TD attempt that fumbles

### 4. Coverage Units

Covering kicks and punts prevents big returns and pins opponents deep.

**Kickoff Coverage:**

**Coverage Strategy:**
- **Stay in lanes:** Each player has a lane assignment
- **Converge on ball carrier:** All 11 players pursue
- **Contain outside:** Force returner inside to help
- **Wrap up tackles:** Don't go for big hits, secure tackle

**User Control Tips:**
- User control a fast player (safety or corner on coverage unit)
- Sprint down field but stay in your lane
- Don't overrun the play - take proper angle
- Make the tackle or force returner to cutback to help

**Punt Coverage:**

**Coverage Principles:**
- **Get downfield quickly:** Sprint as soon as ball is punted
- **Stay in lanes:** Don't let returner find gaps
- **Slow down near returner:** Break down, don't dive from far away
- **Secure tackle:** Wrap up, don't go for strip

**Gunner Play (Outside coverage players):**
- Try to get past blockers quickly
- Sprint to returner's location
- Force fair catch with pressure
- Make first contact if returner catches

### 5. Blocking Kicks

Blocking kicks changes games and creates momentum shifts.

**Blocking Field Goals and Punts:**

**How to Attempt a Block:**
- Call FG Block or Punt Block play from playcalling menu
- These plays send more rushers and use aggressive angles
- User control a fast edge rusher or DT
- Time your jump at the kicker

**Blocking Technique:**
1. **Choose your rusher:** Pick fastest player with best angle
2. **Sprint at gap:** Find gap in protection, sprint through (R2)
3. **Time the jump:** Press Triangle to jump as ball is kicked
4. **Block the kick:** If timed right, you'll block it
5. **Recover fumble:** Blocked kicks are live balls, recover for TD opportunity

**When to Try Blocks:**
- **Long field goals (50+ yards):** Longer kicks take more time
- **Into the wind:** Kicker may rush, better block chance
- **Obvious punts:** 4th and long, you know punt is coming
- **Desperation:** Trailing late, need big play

**Block Risks:**
- Aggressive rush leaves you vulnerable to fakes
- Missed block gives good return opportunity
- Roughing the kicker penalty if you hit kicker

### 6. Trick Plays

**Fake Field Goals:**

High-risk plays that can catch defense off guard for first downs or TDs.

**When to Fake:**
- 4th and short (1-3 yards)
- Defense shows all-out rush
- You've been kicking all game (they won't expect it)
- Trailing and need momentum

**How to Execute:**
- Call Fake FG play before snap
- Play is either a run by holder or pass by holder
- Recognize defense - if they're defending fake, audible to real kick
- Execute as normal offensive play

**Success Rate:** Low (20-30%) - risky but can change games

**Fake Punts:**

Similar to fake FGs but from punt formation.

**When to Fake:**
- 4th and short (1-3 yards)
- Defense is playing back for punt return
- In opponent territory, can't pin them deep anyway
- Need to catch them off guard

**Execution:**
- Call Fake Punt play
- Usually punter runs or throws
- Read the defense
- Get the first down

**Onside Kicks:**

Attempting to recover your own kickoff.

**How to Execute Onside Kick (PlayStation):**
1. Call Onside Kick from playcalling menu
2. Choose left or right side
3. Execute normal kick meter (aim toward chosen side)
4. 50-60% power to make it go 10+ yards but not too far
5. Switch to nearest player (Triangle)
6. Sprint to ball (R2) and dive (Square) or catch (Triangle)

**Onside Kick Strategy:**

**When to Onside Kick:**
- Trailing late (under 5 minutes, down 2+ scores)
- Need possession desperately
- End of half if receiving second half kickoff
- Surprise onside early (rare, very risky)

**Onside Success Factors:**
- **Surprise:** Unexpected onside kicks have higher success
- **Execution:** Must go 10 yards but not too far
- **Recovery:** Need to get to ball first
- **Bounces:** Lucky bounces help

**Success Rate:** 10-20% on average, 30-40% if surprise

**Trick Play Tips:**
- **Don't overuse:** They only work when unexpected
- **Risk vs. Reward:** Understand the situation
- **Have a plan:** Know what you'll do if defense adjusts
- **Sell it:** Make it look like normal kick until the last second

### 7. Two-Point Conversions

Going for 2 points instead of kicking the extra point.

**When to Go for Two:**

**By Score Differential:**
- **Down 14:** Go for 2 if you score - need two TDs either way
- **Down 8:** Go for 2 if you score - makes it one-score game
- **Down 2:** Go for 2 if you score - go ahead by 4 instead of 3
- **Up 7:** Don't go for 2 - up 8 or up 9 isn't much different
- **Up 1:** Go for 2 - up 3 is much better than up 2

**Late Game Situations:**
- **Trailing late:** Go for 2 more often - might need it
- **Leading late:** Kick XP - don't risk giving momentum
- **Analytics:** Modern analytics say go for 2 more than conventional wisdom

**Two-Point Conversion Strategy:**

**Best Plays:**
- **Quick slants:** Quick throw, hard to defend in tight space
- **Power run:** QB sneak or RB up middle
- **RPO:** Read the defense, hand off or pass
- **Play action:** Fake run, throw to TE or back of end zone

**Success Rate:** Approximately 50% league-wide

**Two-Point Tips:**
- Have 2-3 plays you're comfortable with
- Read the defense - if they're defending pass, run it
- Don't force it - sometimes taking the sack is better than INT

### 8. Situational Special Teams

**End of Half/Game:**
- **Leading with seconds left:** Squib kick to prevent return TD
- **Trailing with seconds left:** May need to attempt long FG (55+)
- **Tied game at end of regulation:** Kick FG to win, don't risk turnover

**Weather Conditions:**
- **Strong wind:** Affects FGs and punts significantly
  - Kick with wind: Use less power
  - Kick into wind: Use more power, may be impossible from 50+
  - Crosswind: Aim into wind to compensate
- **Rain/Snow:** Kicking meter is harder, more slippery
  - Kick shorter FGs, don't attempt 50+ unless necessary
  - Punts can slip, be careful

**Field Position Decisions:**

**4th Down Decision Chart:**
- **Own territory (1-40):** Always punt unless 4th and 1-2
- **Midfield (40-50):** Punt unless 4th and 1-3
- **Opponent territory (opp 40-35):** Punt or go for it depending on distance
- **Field goal range (inside opp 35):** Attempt FG
- **Inside opp 10:** Usually go for TD unless 4th and long

**Special Teams Field Position Impact:**
- Starting at 25 vs. starting at 40 = 15 yards = huge difference
- Good special teams = 3-5 field goals worth of field position per game
- Returns and coverage are underrated impact on winning
